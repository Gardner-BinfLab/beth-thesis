F 3.5: Please clarify
	- "showing that these annotations closely overlap" differences of over 20 nt seems 'far' rather than 'close' for a ±35 nt 'gene'. It is also unclear what percentage of the dataset these overlaps represent.
F 3.10: Question
	- There seems to be a large group of Vertical sRNA's at ±30%, could this be an effect of selection criteria, biology or just due to limited sample sizes?
F 3.11: Question
	- To what extent are the MGE annotations and reported % part of the actual classification of horizontal vs vertical?
	- It seems like what was used to define the label is now used to study characteristics of the label

L 8: Please consider rewording
	- It is unclear what the 'clear picture' looks like and how the manual steps could be automated.
	- It is unclear what the statement relating to high false positives relates too.
L 14: Please check
	- Last part "comparisons of intergenic expressed regions to identify conserved and expressed intergenic regions" seems a bit convoluted
L 17: Please clarify
	- "{de novo} gene evolution," is it de novo occurrence or the evolution of novel genes?
L 38: Please clarify
	- "provide a metric for classification" unclear what sort of metric
	- "MGE" abbreviation not defined
L 49: Please clarify
	- "sRNAs were effective in by providing increasing sensitivity without specificity" unclear what is meant
L 51: Please clarify
	- "as a proxy for regulon size, which appears to restrict sequence conservation" unclear what is meant
L 68: Please clarify
	- "However, this analysis was limited as the design" limited in power?
L 85: Consider rewording
	- "genetic elements will likely feature heavily, as larger MGEs such as...." convoluted sentence
