              cell biology lies in their possession of intracellular membrane
              compartmentation. All planctomycetes share a unique cell plan, in
              which the cell cytoplasm is divided into compartments by one or
              more membranes, including a major cell compartment containing the
              nucleoid. Of special significance is Gemmata obscuriglobus, in
              which the nucleoid is enveloped in two membranes to form a
              nuclear body that is analogous to the structure of a eukaryotic
              nucleus. Planctomycete compartmentation may have functional
              physiological roles, as in the case of anaerobic

              anammoxosome harbors specialized enzymes and is wrapped in an
              envelope possessing unique ladderane lipids. Organisms in phyla

  author   = "Touchon, Marie and Rocha, Eduardo P C",
  abstract = "Insertion sequences (ISs) are the smallest and most frequent
              transposable elements in prokaryotes where they play an important
              evolutionary role by promoting gene inactivation and genome
              plasticity. Their genomic abundance varies by several orders of
              magnitude for reasons largely unknown and widely speculated. The
              current availability of hundreds of genomes renders testable many
              of these hypotheses, notably that IS abundance correlates
              positively with the frequency of horizontal gene transfer (HGT),
              genome size, pathogenicity, nonobligatory ecological
              associations, and human association. We thus reannotated ISs in
              262 prokaryotic genomes and tested these hypotheses showing that
              when using appropriate controls, there is no empirical basis for
              IS family specificity, pathogenicity, or human association to
              influence IS abundance or density. HGT seems necessary for the
              presence of ISs, but cannot alone explain the absence of ISs in
              more than 20\% of the organisms, some of which showing high rates
              of HGT. Gene transfer is also not a significant determinant of
              the abundance of IS elements in genomes, suggesting that IS
              abundance is controlled at the level of transposition and ensuing
              natural selection and not at the level of infection. Prokaryotes
              engaging in obligatory associations have fewer ISs when
              controlled for genome size, but this may be caused by some being
              sexually isolated. Surprisingly, genome size is the only
              significant predictor of IS numbers and density. Alone, it
              explains over 40\% of the variance of IS abundance. Because we
              find that genome size and IS abundance correlate negatively with
              minimal doubling times, we conclude that selection for rapid
              replication cannot account for the few ISs found in small
              genomes. Instead, we show evidence that IS numbers are controlled
              by the frequency of highly deleterious insertion targets. Indeed,
              IS abundance increases quickly with genome size, which is the
              exact inverse trend found for the density of genes under strong
              selection such as essential genes. Hence, for ISs, the bigger the
              genome the better.",

              The genome of M. aeruginosa is a single, circular chromosome of
              5,842,795 base pairs (bp) in length, with an average GC content
              of 42.3\%. The chromosome comprises 6312 putative

              representing 41 tRNA species, and genes for tmRNA, the B subunit
              of RNase P, SRP RNA, and 6Sa RNA. Forty-five percent of the
              putative protein-encoding sequences showed sequence similarity to
              genes of known function, 32\% were similar to hypothetical genes,
              and the remaining 23\% had no apparent similarity to reported

              full-length transposase open reading frames of these ISs
              suggested (i) the occurrence of positive selection and (ii) the
              presence of one or more positively selected codons. These results
              were obtained using three data sets of transposase genes from the

              acid similarity, the presence of an inverted repeat, and the

              important. The finding that this type of selection acts on
              IS-carried genes is intriguing, because although ISs have been
              associated with the adaptation of the bacterial host to new
              environments, this has typically been attributed to transposition
              or transformation, thus involving different genomic locations.
              Intragenic adaptation of IS-carried genes identified here may

  author   = "Darling, Aaron E and Mau, Bob and Perna, Nicole T",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Multiple genome alignment remains a challenging
              problem. Effects of recombination including rearrangement,
              segmental duplication, gain, and loss can create a mosaic pattern
              of homology even among closely related organisms.
              METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We describe a new method to align
              two or more genomes that have undergone rearrangements due to
              recombination and substantial amounts of segmental gain and loss
              (flux). We demonstrate that the new method can accurately align
              regions conserved in some, but not all, of the genomes, an
              important case not handled by our previous work. The method uses
              a novel alignment objective score called a sum-of-pairs
              breakpoint score, which facilitates accurate detection of
              rearrangement breakpoints when genomes have unequal gene content.
              We also apply a probabilistic alignment filtering method to
              remove erroneous alignments of unrelated sequences, which are
              commonly observed in other genome alignment methods. We describe
              new metrics for quantifying genome alignment accuracy which
              measure the quality of rearrangement breakpoint predictions and
              indel predictions. The new genome alignment algorithm
              demonstrates high accuracy in situations where genomes have
              undergone biologically feasible amounts of genome rearrangement,
              segmental gain and loss. We apply the new algorithm to a set of
              23 genomes from the genera Escherichia, Shigella, and Salmonella.
              Analysis of whole-genome multiple alignments allows us to extend
              the previously defined concepts of core- and pan-genomes to
              include not only annotated genes, but also non-coding regions
              with potential regulatory roles. The 23 enterobacteria have an
              estimated core-genome of 2.46Mbp conserved among all taxa and a
              pan-genome of 15.2Mbp. We document substantial population-level
              variability among these organisms driven by segmental gain and
              loss. Interestingly, much variability lies in intergenic regions,
              suggesting that the Enterobacteriacae may exhibit regulatory
              divergence. CONCLUSIONS: The multiple genome alignments generated
              by our software provide a platform for comparative genomic and
              population genomic studies. Free, open-source software
              implementing the described genome alignment approach is available

              transposable elements. Although active elements generally
              transpose more rapidly than they are inactivated by mutation or
              excision, their number can be kept in check by purifying
              selection if its effectiveness becomes disproportionately greater
              as their copy number increases. In sexually reproducing species,
              such synergistic selection can result from ectopic crossing-over
              or from homologous recombination under negative epistasis. In
              addition, there may be controls on transposon activity that are
              associated with meiosis. Because a sexual lineage that abandons
              sex must lack such mechanisms, it may be driven to extinction by
              the unchecked proliferation of deleterious transposons inherited
              from its sexual progenitor. An important component of the
              evolutionary advantage of sex over asex may therefore lie in the

              end for metazoans, but bdelloid rotifers challenge this view as
              they appear to have persisted asexually for millions of years.
              Neither male sex organs nor meiosis have ever been observed in
              these microscopic animals: oocytes are formed through mitotic
              divisions, with no reduction of chromosome number and no
              indication of chromosome pairing. However, current evidence does
              not exclude that they may engage in sex on rare, cryptic
              occasions. Here we report the genome of a bdelloid rotifer,
              Adineta vaga (Davis, 1873), and show that its structure is
              incompatible with conventional meiosis. At gene scale, the genome
              of A. vaga is tetraploid and comprises both anciently duplicated
              segments and less divergent allelic regions. However, in contrast
              to sexual species, the allelic regions are rearranged and
              sometimes even found on the same chromosome. Such structure does
              not allow meiotic pairing; instead, we find abundant evidence of
              gene conversion, which may limit the accumulation of deleterious
              mutations in the absence of meiosis. Gene families involved in
              resistance to oxidation, carbohydrate metabolism and defence
              against transposons are significantly expanded, which may explain
              why transposable elements cover only 3\% of the assembled
              sequence. Furthermore, 8\% of the genes are likely to be of
              non-metazoan origin and were probably acquired horizontally. This
              apparent convergence between bdelloids and prokaryotes sheds new
              light on the evolutionary significance of sex.",

              mediators of genome plasticity and are widespread among bacterial
              and archaeal genomes. The 1.88 Mbp genome of the obligate
              intracellular amoeba symbiont Amoebophilus asiaticus contains an
              unusually large number of transposase genes (n = 354; 23\% of all
              genes). RESULTS: The transposase genes in the A. asiaticus genome
              can be assigned to 16 different IS elements termed ISCaa1 to
              ISCaa16, which are represented by 2 to 24 full-length copies,
              respectively. Despite this high IS element load, the A. asiaticus
              genome displays a GC skew pattern typical for most bacterial
              genomes, indicating that no major rearrangements have occurred
              recently. Additionally, the high sequence divergence of some IS
              elements, the high number of truncated IS element copies (n =
              143), as well as the absence of direct repeats in most IS
              elements suggest that the IS elements of A. asiaticus are
              transpositionally inactive. Although we could show transcription
              of 13 IS elements, we did not find experimental evidence for
              transpositional activity, corroborating our results from sequence
              analyses. However, we detected contiguous transcripts between IS
              elements and their downstream genes at nine loci in the A.

              transcription of downstream genes, some of which might be
              important for host cell interaction. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together,
              the IS elements in the A. asiaticus genome are currently in the
              process of degradation and largely represent reflections of the
              evolutionary past of A. asiaticus in which its genome was shaped

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Insertion sequences (ISs) are approximately 1 kbp
              long ``jumping'' genes found in prokaryotes. ISs encode the
              protein Transposase, which facilitates the excision and
              reinsertion of ISs in genomes, making these sequences a type of
              class I (``cut-and-paste'') Mobile Genetic Elements. ISs are
              proposed to be involved in the reductive evolution of symbiotic
              prokaryotes. Our previous sequencing of the genome of the
              cyanobacterium 'Nostoc azollae' 0708, living in a tight perpetual
              symbiotic association with a plant (the water fern Azolla),
              revealed the presence of an eroding genome, with a high number of
              insertion sequences (ISs) together with an unprecedented large
              proportion of pseudogenes. To investigate the role of ISs in the
              reductive evolution of 'Nostoc azollae' 0708, and potentially in
              the formation of pseudogenes, a bioinformatic investigation of
              the IS identities and positions in 47 cyanobacterial genomes was
              conducted. To widen the scope, the IS contents were analysed
              qualitatively and quantitatively in 20 other genomes representing
              both free-living and symbiotic bacteria. RESULTS: Insertion
              Sequences were not randomly distributed in the bacterial genomes
              and were found to transpose short distances from their original
              location (``local hopping'') and pseudogenes were enriched in the
              vicinity of IS elements. In general, symbiotic organisms showed
              higher densities of IS elements and pseudogenes than
              non-symbiotic bacteria. A total of 1108 distinct repeated
              sequences over 500 bp were identified in the 67 genomes
              investigated. In the genome of 'Nostoc azollae' 0708, IS elements
              were apparent at 970 locations (14.3\%), with 428 being
              full-length. Morphologically complex cyanobacteria with large
              genomes showed higher frequencies of IS elements, irrespective of
              life style. CONCLUSIONS: The apparent co-location of IS elements
              and pseudogenes found in prokaryotic genomes implies earlier IS
              transpositions into genes. As transpositions tend to be local
              rather than genome wide this likely explains the proximity
              between IS elements and pseudogenes. These findings suggest that
              ISs facilitate the reductive evolution in for instance in the
              symbiotic cyanobacterium 'Nostoc azollae' 0708 and in other
              obligate prokaryotic symbionts.",

              can either be linked or unlinked (a 16S gene is in a separate

  abstract = "Bacteria of the phylum Planctomycetes are of special interest for
              the study of compartmental cellular organization. Members of this
              phylum share a very unusual prokaryotic cell plan, featuring
              several membrane-bound compartments. Recently, it was shown that
              this cellular organization might extend to certain members of the
              phylum Verrucomicrobia. The Planctomycete cell plan has been
              defined as featuring a proteinaceous cell wall, a cytoplasmic
              membrane surrounding the paryphoplasm, and an intracytoplasmic
              membrane defining the riboplasm. So far it was presumed that
              Planctomycetes did not have an asymmetric bilayer outer membrane
              as observed in Gram-negative bacteria. However, recent work on
              outer membrane biogenesis has provided several marker genes in
              the outer membrane protein (OMP) assembly and the
              lipopolysaccharide (LPS) insertion complexes. Additionally,
              advances in computational prediction of OMPs provided new tools
              to perform more accurate genomic screening for such proteins.
              Here we searched all 22 Planctomycetes and Verrucomicrobia
              genomes available in GenBank, plus the recently published genome
              of ``Candidatus Scalindua profunda,'' for markers of outer
              membrane biogenesis and OMPs. We were able to identify the key
              components of LPS insertion, OMP assembly and at least eight OMPs
              in all genomes tested. Additionally, we have analyzed the
              transcriptome and proteome data of the Planctomycetes
              ``Candidatus Kuenenia stuttgartiensis'' and ``Ca. S. profunda''
              and could confirm high expression of several predicted OMPs,
              including the biomarkers of outer membrane biogenesis. These
              analyses provide a strong indication that an asymmetrical outer
              membrane may be present in bacteria of both phyla. However,
              previous experiments have made obvious that the cell envelope of
              Planctomycetes is clearly divergent from both the Gram-negative
              and Gram-positive cell types. Thus, the functional implications
              of the presence of an outer membrane for the Planctomycete cell
              plan and compartmentalization are discussed and a revised model
              including an outer membrane is proposed. Although this model
              agrees with most experimental data, we do note that the presence,
              location, and role of an outer membrane within the Planctomycetes
              and Verrucomicrobia awaits further experimental validation.",

              properties, contributing to a cell plan long considered to be
              unique among the bacteria. However, data from recent studies are
              more consistent with a modified Gram-negative cell plan. A key
              feature of the Gram-negative plan is the presence of an outer
              membrane (OM), for which lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a signature
              molecule. Despite genomic evidence for an OM in planctomycetes,
              no biochemical verification has been reported. We attempted to
              detect and characterize LPS in the planctomycete Gemmata
              obscuriglobus. We obtained direct evidence for LPS and lipid A
              using electrophoresis and differential staining. Gas
              chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) compositional analysis
              of LPS extracts identified eight different 3-hydroxy fatty acids
              (3-HOFAs), 2-keto 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo),
              glucosamine, and hexose and heptose sugars, a chemical profile
              unique to Gram-negative LPS. Combined with molecular/structural
              information collected from matrix-assisted laser desorption
              ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) MS analysis of putative
              intact lipid A, these data led us to propose a heterogeneous
              hexa-acylated lipid A structure (multiple-lipid A species). We
              also confirmed previous reports of G. obscuriglobus whole-cell
              fatty acid (FA) and sterol compositions and detected a novel
              polyunsaturated FA (PUFA). Our confirmation of LPS, and by
              implication an OM, in G. obscuriglobus raises the possibility
              that other planctomycetes possess an OM. The pursuit of this
              question, together with studies of the structural connections
              between planctomycete LPS and peptidoglycans, will shed more
              light on what appears to be a planctomycete variation on the
              Gram-negative cell plan. IMPORTANCE: Bacterial species are
              classified as Gram positive or negative based on their cell
              envelope structure. For 25 years, the envelope of planctomycete
              bacteria has been considered a unique exception, as it lacks
              peptidoglycan and an outer membrane (OM). However, the very
              recent detection of peptidoglycan in planctomycete species has
              provided evidence for a more conventional cell wall and raised
              questions about other elements of the cell envelope. Here, we
              report direct evidence of lipopolysaccharide in the planctomycete
              G. obscuriglobus, suggesting the presence of an OM and supporting
              the proposal that the planctomycete cell envelope is an extension
              of the canonical Gram-negative plan. This interpretation features
              a convoluted cytoplasmic membrane and expanded periplasmic space,
              the functions of which provide an intriguing avenue for future
              investigation.",

              cyanobacterial (Synechococcus OS-A and OS-B') isolates
              representing ecologically distinct populations that dominate at
              different temperatures and are major primary producers in the
              mat. There was a marked lack of conserved large-scale gene order
              between the two Synechococcus genomes, indicative of extensive
              genomic rearrangements. Comparative genomic analyses showed that
              the isolates shared a large fraction of their gene content at
              high identity, yet, differences in phosphate and nitrogen
              utilization pathways indicated that they have adapted

              genes by lateral gene transfer or their loss in certain
              populations. Comparisons of the Synechococcus genomes to
              metagenomic sequences derived from mats where these Synechococcus
              stains were originally isolated, revealed new facets of microbial
              diversity. First, Synechococcus populations at the lower
              temperature regions of the mat showed greater sequence diversity
              than those at high temperatures, consistent with a greater number
              of ecologically distinct populations at the lower temperature.
              Second, we found evidence of a specialized population that is
              apparently very closely related to Synechococcus OS-B', but

              expression when the mats are anoxic and iron may be in the

              important role in bacterial genome plasticity and host adaptation
              but their transcriptional activity in natural bacterial
              communities is largely unexplored. Here we analyzed metagenomes
              and -transcriptomes of size fractionated (0.1-0.8, 0.8-3.0 and
              3.0-200 $\mu$m) bacterial communities from the brackish Baltic
              Sea, and adjacent marine waters. The Baltic Sea transposase
              levels, up to 1.7\% of bacterial genes and 2\% of bacterial
              transcripts, were considerably higher than in marine waters and
              similar to levels reported for extreme environments. Large
              variations in expression were found between transposase families
              and groups of bacteria, with a two-fold higher transcription in
              Cyanobacteria than in any other phylum. The community-level
              results were corroborated at the genus level by Synechococcus
              transposases reaching up to 5.2\% of genes and 6.9\% of
              transcripts, which is in contrast to marine Synechococcus that
              largely lack these genes. Levels peaked in Synechococcus from the
              largest size fraction, suggesting high frequencies of lateral
              gene transfer and high genome plasticity in colony-forming
              picocyanobacteria. Together, the results support an elevated rate
              of transposition-based genome change and adaptation in bacterial
              populations of the Baltic Sea, and possibly also of other highly
              dynamic estuarine waters.",

  abstract = "Diverse marine fish and squid form symbiotic associations with
              extracellular bioluminescent bacteria. These symbionts are
              typically free-living bacteria with large genomes, but one known
              lineage of symbionts has undergone genomic reduction and
              evolution of host dependence. It is not known why distinct
              evolutionary trajectories have occurred among different luminous
              symbionts, and not all known lineages previously had genome
              sequences available. In order to better understand patterns of
              evolution across diverse bioluminescent symbionts, we de novo
              sequenced the genomes of bacteria from a poorly studied
              interaction, the extracellular symbionts from the ``lures'' of
              deep-sea ceratioid anglerfishes. Deep-sea anglerfish symbiont
              genomes are reduced in size by about 50\% compared to free-living
              relatives. They show a striking convergence of genome reduction
              and loss of metabolic capabilities with a distinct lineage of
              obligately host-dependent luminous symbionts. These losses
              include reductions in amino acid synthesis pathways and abilities
              to utilize diverse sugars. However, the symbiont genomes have
              retained a number of categories of genes predicted to be useful
              only outside the host, such as those involved in chemotaxis and
              motility, suggesting that they may persist in the environment.
              These genomes contain very high numbers of pseudogenes and show
              massive expansions of transposable elements, with transposases
              accounting for 28 and 31\% of coding sequences in the symbiont
              genomes. Transposon expansions appear to have occurred at
              different times in each symbiont lineage, indicating either
              independent evolutions of reduction or symbiont replacement.
              These results suggest ongoing genomic reduction in extracellular
              luminous symbionts that is facilitated by transposon
              proliferations.IMPORTANCE Many female deep-sea anglerfishes
              possess a ``lure'' containing luminous bacterial symbionts. Here
              we show that unlike most luminous symbionts, these bacteria are
              undergoing an evolutionary transition toward small genomes with
              limited metabolic capabilities. Comparative analyses of the
              symbiont genomes indicate that this transition is ongoing and
              facilitated by transposon expansions. This transition may have
              occurred independently in different symbiont lineages, although
              it is unclear why. Genomic reduction is common in bacteria that
              only live within host cells but less common in bacteria that,
              like anglerfish symbionts, live outside host cells. Since
              multiple evolutions of genomic reduction have occurred
              convergently in luminous bacteria, they make a useful system with
              which to understand patterns of genome evolution in extracellular
              symbionts. This work demonstrates that ecological factors other
              than an intracellular lifestyle can lead to dramatic gene loss
              and evolutionary changes and that transposon expansions may play
              important roles in this process.",
