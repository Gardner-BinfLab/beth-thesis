  abstract = "UNLABELLED: Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae is the causal
              agent of bacterial canker of green-fleshed kiwifruit (Actinidia
              deliciosa) and yellow-fleshed kiwifruit (A. chinensis). A recent,
              sudden, re-emerging wave of this disease has occurred, almost
              contemporaneously, in all of the main areas of kiwifruit
              production in the world, suggesting that it can be considered as
              a pandemic disease. Recent in-depth genetic studies performed on
              P. syringae pv. actinidiae strains have revealed that this
              pathovar is composed of four genetically different populations
              which, to different extents, can infect crops of the genus
              Actinidia worldwide. Genome comparisons of these strains have
              revealed that this pathovar can gain and lose the phaseolotoxin
              gene cluster, as well as mobile genetic elements, such as
              plasmids and putative prophages, and that it can modify the
              repertoire of the effector gene arrays. In addition, the strains
              currently causing worldwide severe economic losses display an
              extensive set of genes related to the ecological fitness of the
              bacterium in planta, such as copper and antibiotic resistance
              genes, multiple siderophore genes and genes involved in the
              degradation of lignin derivatives and other phenolics. This
              pathogen can therefore easily colonize hosts throughout the year.
              TAXONOMY: Bacteria; Proteobacteria, gamma subdivision; Order
              Pseudomonadales; Family Pseudomonadaceae; Genus Pseudomonas;
              Pseudomonas syringae species complex, genomospecies 8; Pathovar
              actinidiae. MICROBIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES: Gram-negative, aerobic,
              motile, rod-shaped, polar flagella, oxidase-negative, arginine
              dihydrolase-negative, DNA 58.5-58.8 mol.\% GC, elicits the
              hypersensitive response on tobacco leaves. HOST RANGE: Primarily
              studied as the causal agent of bacterial canker of green-fleshed
              kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa), it has also been isolated from
              yellow-fleshed kiwifruit (A. chinensis). In both species, it
              causes severe economic losses worldwide. It has also been
              isolated from wild A. arguta and A. kolomikta. DISEASE SYMPTOMS:
              In green-fleshed and yellow-fleshed kiwifruits, the symptoms
              include brown-black leaf spots often surrounded by a chlorotic
              margin, blossom necrosis, extensive twig die-back, reddening of
              the lenticels, extensive cankers along the main trunk and leader,
              and bleeding cankers on the trunk and the leader with a whitish
              to orange ooze. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae
              can effectively colonize its host plants throughout the year.
              Bacterial exudates can disperse a large amount of inoculum within
              and between orchards. In the spring, temperatures ranging from 12
              to 18 Â°C, together with humid conditions, can greatly favour the
              multiplication of the bacterium, allowing it to systemically move
              from the leaf to the young shoots. During the summer, very high
              temperatures can reduce the multiplication and dispersal of the
              bacterium. Some agronomical techniques, as well as frost, wind,
              rain and hail storms, can contribute to further spreading.
              DISEASE CONTROL: An integrated approach that takes into
              consideration precise scheduled spray treatments with effective
              and environmentally friendly bactericides and equilibrated plant
              nutrition, coupled with preventive measures aimed at drastically
              reducing the bacterial inoculum, currently seems to be the
              possible best solution for coexistence with the disease. The
              development of resistant cultivars and pollinators, effective
              biocontrol agents, including bacteriophages, and compounds that
              induce the systemic activation of plant defence mechanisms is in
              progress. USEFUL WEBSITES: Up-to-date information on bacterial

              most serious threats to world agriculture. One emerging disease
              is bacterial canker of kiwi fruit (Actinidia deliciosa and A.
              chinensis) caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (PSA).
              The disease first occurred in China and Japan in the 1980s and in
              Korea and Italy in the 1990s. A more severe form of the disease
              broke out in Italy in 2008 and in additional countries in 2010
              and 2011 threatening the viability of the global kiwi fruit
              industry. To start investigating the source and routes of
              international transmission of PSA, genomes of strains from China
              (the country of origin of the genus Actinidia), Japan, Korea,
              Italy and Portugal have been sequenced. Strains from China,
              Italy, and Portugal have been found to belong to the same clonal
              lineage with only 6 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in
              3,453,192 bp and one genomic island distinguishing the Chinese
              strains from the European strains. Not more than two SNPs
              distinguish each of the Italian and Portuguese strains from each
              other. The Japanese and Korean strains belong to a separate
              genetic lineage as previously reported. Analysis of additional
              European isolates and of New Zealand isolates exploiting
              genome-derived markers showed that these strains belong to the
              same lineage as the Italian and Chinese strains. Interestingly,
              the analyzed New Zealand strains are identical to European
              strains at the tested SNP loci but test positive for the genomic
              island present in the sequenced Chinese strains and negative for
              the genomic island present in the European strains. Results are
              interpreted in regard to the possible direction of movement of

  abstract = "Many bacterial pathogens are well characterized but, in some

              emerged. This limits understanding of the molecular mechanisms
              underlying disease. The crop pathogen Pseudomonas syringae sensu
              lato has been widely isolated from the environment, including
              wild plants and components of the water cycle, and causes disease
              in several economically important crops. Here, we compared genome
              sequences of 45 P. syringae crop pathogen outbreak strains with
              69 closely related environmental isolates. Phylogenetic
              reconstruction revealed that crop pathogens emerged many times
              independently from environmental populations. Unexpectedly,
              differences in gene content between environmental populations and
              outbreak strains were minimal with most virulence genes present
              in both. However, a genome-wide association study identified a
              small number of genes, including the type III effector genes
              hopQ1 and hopD1, to be associated with crop pathogens, but not
              with environmental populations, suggesting that this small group
              of genes may play an important role in crop disease emergence.
              Intriguingly, genome-wide analysis of homologous recombination
              revealed that the locus Psyr 0346, predicted to encode a protein
              that confers antibiotic resistance, has been frequently exchanged
              among lineages and thus may contribute to pathogen fitness.
              Finally, we found that isolates from diseased crops and from
              components of the water cycle, collected during the same crop
              disease epidemic, form a single population. This provides the
              strongest evidence yet that precipitation and irrigation water

              millennia--ago, thus limiting opportunity to understand the
              concomitant emergence of disease. Kiwifruit (Actinidia spp.) is
              an exception: domestication began in the 1930s with outbreaks of
              canker disease caused by P. syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa) first
              recorded in the 1980s. Based on SNP analyses of two circularized
              and 34 draft genomes, we show that Psa is comprised of distinct
              clades exhibiting negligible within-clade diversity, consistent
              with disease arising by independent samplings from a source
              population. Three clades correspond to their geographical source
              of isolation; a fourth, encompassing the Psa-V lineage
              responsible for the 2008 outbreak, is now globally distributed.
              Psa has an overall clonal population structure, however, genomes
              carry a marked signature of within-pathovar recombination. SNP
              analysis of Psa-V reveals hundreds of polymorphisms; however,
              most reside within PPHGI-1-like conjugative elements whose
              evolution is unlinked to the core genome. Removal of SNPs due to
              recombination yields an uninformative (star-like) phylogeny
              consistent with diversification of Psa-V from a single clone
              within the last ten years. Growth assays provide evidence of
              cultivar specificity, with rapid systemic movement of Psa-V in

              orthologs in vascular pathogens were found exclusively within

              canker in kiwifruit (Actinidia spp.) vines, was first detected in
              Japan in 1984, followed by detections in Korea and Italy in the
              early 1990s. Isolates causing more severe disease symptoms have

              distribution, including Italy, New Zealand, and China. In order
              to characterize P. syringae pv. actinidiae populations globally,
              a representative set of 40 isolates from New Zealand, Italy,
              Japan, South Korea, Australia, and Chile were selected for
              extensive genetic analysis. Multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA)
              of housekeeping, type III effector and phytotoxin genes was used
              to elucidate the phylogenetic relationships between P. syringae
              pv. actinidiae isolates worldwide. Four additional isolates,
              including one from China, for which shotgun sequence of the whole
              genome was available, were included in phylogenetic analyses. It
              is shown that at least four P. syringae pv. actinidiae MLSA
              groups are present globally, and that marker sets with differing
              evolutionary trajectories (conserved housekeeping and rapidly
              evolving effector genes) readily differentiate all four groups.
              The MLSA group designated here as Psa3 is the strain causing
              secondary symptoms such as formation of cankers, production of
              exudates, and cane and shoot dieback on some kiwifruit orchards

    volume={8},
    ISSN={1932-6203},
    abstractNote={A recently emerged plant disease, bacterial canker of kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa and A. chinensis), is caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (PSA). The disease was first reported in China and Japan in the 1980s. A severe outbreak of PSA began in Italy in 2008 and has spread to other European countries. PSA was found in both New Zealand and Chile in 2010. To study the evolution of the pathogen and analyse the transmission of PSA between countries, genomes of strains from China and Japan (where the genus Actinidia is endemic), Italy, New Zealand and Chile were sequenced. The genomes of PSA strains are very similar. However, all strains from New Zealand share several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that distinguish them from all other PSA strains. Similarly, all the PSA strains from the 2008 Italian outbreak form a distinct clonal group and those from Chile form a third group. In addition to the rare SNPs present in the core genomes, there is abundant genetic diversity in a genomic island that is part of the accessory genome. The island from several Chinese strains is almost identical to the island present in the New Zealand strains. The island from a different Chinese strain is identical to the island present in the strains from the recent Italian outbreak. The Chilean strains of PSA carry a third variant of this island. These genomic islands are integrative conjugative elements (ICEs). Sequencing of these ICEs provides evidence of three recent horizontal transmissions of ICE from other strains of Pseudomonas syringae to PSA. The analyses of the core genome SNPs and the ICEs, combined with disease history, all support the hypothesis of an independent Chinese origin for both the Italian and the New Zealand outbreaks and suggest the Chilean strains also originate from China.},

              point for pathogens such as Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae
              (Psa). This bacterium can colonize both male and female Actinidia
              flowers, causing flower browning and fall, and systemic invasion
              of the host plant, eventually leading to its death. However, the
              process of flower colonization and penetration into the host
              tissues has not yet been fully elucidated. In addition, the
              presence of Psa in the pollen from infected flowers, and the role
              of pollination in the spread of Psa requires confirmation. The
              present study employed a Psa strain constitutively expressing the
              fluorescent GFPuv protein, to visualize in vivo flower
              colonization. Microscopy observations were performed by means of
              confocal laser scanning and wide-field fluorescent microscopy,
              and were coupled with the study of Psa population dynamics by
              quantitative PCR (q-PCR). The pathogen was shown to colonize
              stigmata, move along the stylar furrow, and penetrate the
              receptacles via the style or nectarhodes. Once the receptacle was
              invaded, the pathogen migrated along the flower pedicel and
              became systemic. Psa was also able to colonize the anthers
              epiphytically and endophytically. Infected male flowers produced
              contaminated pollen, which could transmit Psa to healthy plants.
              Finally, pollinators (Apis mellifera and Bombus terrestris) were
              studied in natural conditions, showing that, although they can be
              contaminated with Psa, the pathogen's transmission via
              pollinators is contrasted by its short survival in the hive.",

    ISSN={0066-4197}, 
    abstractNote={The cloning of avirulence genes has greatly aided our understanding of plant-pathogen specificity. It has proven that the gene-for-gene relationship first noted by Flor is correct--single avirulence gene encoding single protein products indeed are the genetic elements that interact with plant disease resistance genes. Furthermore, firm genetic evidence has provided insight into how two cloned avirulence genes (the TMV coat gene and avrD) cause the HR. The differences in structure of pathogen elicitors also indicates that plants have evolved diverse recognitional mechanisms to detect pathogens. It is appealing to speculate, therefore, that elicitors represent the plant equivalent of antigens in vertebrates. Another consequence of these results has been the establishment of firm genetic and biochemical evidence supporting the elicitor-receptor model for recognition of incompatible pathogen races by plants. In both TMV and bacterial pathogens, we are also beginning to understand how avirulence genes are altered to confound plant recognition of the pathogen. The next few years should yield additional information on avirulence gene structure as well as the important questions of their function in the pathogen and the molecular mechanisms whereby plant recognition occurs. The marked successes in cloning avirulence genes underscore only more forcefully the pressing need to clone and characterize plant disease resistance genes. Certainly an understanding of these genes is required to further our basic knowledge of active defense in plants and to permit their manipulation for improved control of plant diseases in practical agriculture.}, journal={Annual review of genetics},

    abstractNote={The hypersensitive response (HR) of plants resistant to microbial pathogens involves a complex form of programmed cell death (PCD) that differs from developmental PCD in its consistent association with the induction of local and systemic defence responses. Hypersensitive cell death is commonly controlled by direct or indirect interactions between pathogen avirulence gene products and those of plant resistance genes and it can be the result of multiple signalling pathways. Ion fluxes and the generation of reactive oxygen species commonly precede cell death, but a direct involvement of the latter seems to vary with the plant-pathogen combination. Protein synthesis, an intact actin cytoskeleton and salicylic acid also seem necessary for cell death induction. Cytological studies suggest that the actual mode and sequence of dismantling the cell contents varies among plant-parasite systems although there may be a universal involvement of cysteine proteases. It seems likely that cell death within the HR acts more as a signal to the rest of the plant rather than as a direct defence mechanism.}, number={3},

              water. Here, we report the abundance of P. syringae in rain,
              snow, alpine streams and lakes and in wild plants, in addition to
              the previously reported abundance in epilithic biofilms. Each of
              these substrates harbored strains that corresponded to P.
              syringae in terms of biochemical traits, pathogenicity and
              pathogenicity-related factors and that were ice-nucleation

              kiwifruit plantlets, using RNA-seq. Principal component and
              heatmap analyses showed distinct phases of gene expression during

              these genes collectively accounted for 6.3\% of the bacterial
              transcriptome at this stage. There was considerable variation in
              the expression levels of individual T3SEs but all followed the
              same temporal expression pattern, with the exception of hopAS1,
              which peaked later in expression at 48 HPI. As infection
              progressed over the time course of five days, there was an
              increase in the expression of genes with roles in sugar, amino
              acid and sulfur transport and the production of alginate and
              colanic acid. These are both polymers that are major constituents
              of extracellular polysaccharide substances (EPS) and are involved
              in biofilm production. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR
              (RT-qPCR) on an independent infection time course experiment
              showed that the expression profile of selected bacterial genes at
              each infection phase correlated well with the RNA-seq data.
              CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study indicate that there is a
              complex remodeling of the transcriptome during the early stages
              of infection, with at least three distinct phases of coordinated
              gene expression. These include genes induced during the immediate
              contact with the host, those involved in the initiation of
              infection, and finally those responsible for nutrient
              acquisition.",

              genomes. The service identifies protein-encoding, rRNA and tRNA
              genes, assigns functions to the genes, predicts which subsystems
              are represented in the genome, uses this information to
              reconstruct the metabolic network and makes the output easily

              be browsed in an environment that supports comparative analysis
              with the annotated genomes maintained in the SEED environment.
              The service normally makes the annotated genome available within
              12-24 hours of submission, but ultimately the quality of such a

              homoeostatic control of particular importance to living
              organisms. Within the context of plant-pathogen interactions the
              availability and toxicity of transition metals can have a
              substantial impact on disease development. Metals are essential
              for defensive generation of reactive oxygen species and other
              plant defences and can be used directly to limit pathogen growth.
              Metal-based antimicrobials are used in agriculture to control
              plant disease, and there is increasing evidence that metal
              hyperaccumulating plants use accumulated metal to limit pathogen
              growth. Pathogens and hosts compete for available metals, with
              plants possessing mechanisms to withhold essential metals from
              invading microbes. Pathogens, meanwhile, use low-metal conditions
              as a signal to recognise and respond to the host environment.
              Consequently, metal-sensing systems such as fur (iron) and zur
              (zinc) regulate the expression of pathogenicity and virulence

Many such pathways are cell-surface signaling (CSS) systems, which are tripartite molecular devices that allow Gram-negative bacteria to transduce an extracellular stimulus into a coordinated transcriptional response. Typically, CSS systems are composed of the following: (1) an outer membrane receptor, which senses the extracellular stimulus; (2) a cytoplasmic membrane-spanning protein involved in signal transduction from the periplasm to the cytoplasm; and (3) an extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor that initiates expression of the stimulus-responsive gene(s). Members of genus Pseudomonas provide a paradigmatic example of how CSS systems contribute to the global control of gene expression. Most CSS systems enable self-regulated uptake of iron via endogenous (pyoverdine) or exogenous (xenosiderophores, heme, and citrate) carriers. Some are also implicated in virulence, biofilm formation, and cellâcell interactions. Incorporating insights from the well-characterized alginate regulatory circuitry, this review will illustrate common themes and variations at the level of structural and functional properties of Pseudomonas CSS systems. Control of the expression and activity of ECF sigma factors are central to gene regulation via CSS, and the variety of intrinsic and extrinsic factors influencing these processes will be discussed.}",

    volume={15},
    ISSN={1471-2180},
    abstractNote={BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea PG4180 causes bacterial blight on soybean plants and enters the leaf tissue through stomata or open wounds, where it encounters a sucrose-rich milieu. Sucrose is utilized by invading bacteria via the secreted enzyme, levansucrase (Lsc), liberating glucose and forming the polyfructan levan. P. syringae PG4180 possesses two functional lsc alleles transcribed at virulence-promoting low temperatures. RESULTS: We hypothesized that transcription of lsc is controlled by the hexose metabolism repressor, HexR, since potential HexR binding sites were identified upstream of both lsc genes. A hexR mutant of PG4180 was significantly growth-impaired when incubated with sucrose or glucose as sole carbon source, but exhibited wild type growth when arabinose was provided. Analyses of lsc expression resulted in higher transcript and protein levels in the hexR mutant as compared to the wild type. The hexR mutantâs ability to multiply in planta was reduced. HexR did not seem to impact hrp gene expression as evidenced by the hexR mutant's unaltered hypersensitive response in tobacco and its unmodified protein secretion pattern as compared to the wild type under hrp-inducing conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggested a co-regulation of genes involved in extra-cellular sugar acquisition with those involved in intra-cellular energy-providing metabolic pathways in P. syringae.},

    volume={284},
    ISSN={0021-9258},
    abstractNote={In Pseudomonas putida, genes for the glucose phosphorylative pathway and the Entner-Doudoroff pathway are organized in two operons; one made up of the zwf, pgl, and eda genes and another consisting of the edd, glk, gltR2, and gltS genes. Divergently with respect to the edd gene is the gap-1 gene. Expression from P(zwf), P(edd), and P(gap) is modulated by HexR in response to the availability of glucose in the medium. To study the regulatory process in greater detail we purified HexR and showed that it is a monomer in solution. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and isothermal titration calorimetry assays were done showing that HexR recognizes the P(edd), P(zwf), and P(gap-1) promoters with affinity in the nanomolar range. DNA footprinting assays identified the binding site between +30 and +1 at P(zwf), between +16 and +41 at P(edd), and between -6 and +18 at P(gap-1). Based on DNA sequence alignment of the target sites and isothermal titration calorimetry data, two monomers of HexR bind to a pseudopalindrome with a consensus sequence of 5â-TTGTN(7-8)ACAA-3'. Binding of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway intermediate 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate to HexR released the repressor from its target operators, whereas other chemicals such as glucose, glucose 6-phosphate, and 6-phosphogluconate did not induce complex dissociation. The phosphorylated effector is likely to be recognized by a sugar isomerase domain located at the C-terminal end of HexR, whereas the helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain of HexR exhibits high similarity to proteins of the RpiR family of regulators.},

	abstract = {Plant leaves are heavily colonized by microorganisms, but the extent to which the surface sites differ from interior sites in selecting for microbial colonization traits is poorly understood. Global gene-expression studies of the foliar pathogen Pseudomonas syringae reveal that leaf surface sites specifically favor active exploration using flagellar motility, chemosensing, and chemotaxis. In contrast, interior sites favor production of enzymes and secondary compounds that modulate bacterial interactions with the plant and its defense system. Water limitation is a dominating force in both surface and interior sites. These findings provide a rich understanding of the leaf habitats encountered by bacteria.Some strains of the foliar pathogen Pseudomonas syringae are adapted for growth and survival on leaf surfaces and in the leaf interior. Global transcriptome profiling was used to evaluate if these two habitats offer distinct environments for bacteria and thus present distinct driving forces for adaptation. The transcript profiles of Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae B728a support a model in which leaf surface, or epiphytic, sites specifically favor flagellar motility, swarming motility based on 3-(3-hydroxyalkanoyloxy)alkanoic acid surfactant production, chemosensing, and chemotaxis, indicating active relocation primarily on the leaf surface. Epiphytic sites also promote high transcript levels for phenylalanine degradation, which may help counteract phenylpropanoid-based defenses before leaf entry. In contrast, intercellular, or apoplastic, sites favor the high-level expression of genes for GABA metabolism (degradation of these genes would attenuate GABA repression of virulence) and the synthesis of phytotoxins, two additional secondary metabolites, and syringolin A. These findings support roles for these compounds in virulence, including a role for syringolin A in suppressing defense responses beyond stomatal closure. A comparison of the transcriptomes from in planta cells and from cells exposed to osmotic stress, oxidative stress, and iron and nitrogen limitation indicated that water availability, in particular, was limited in both leaf habitats but was more severely limited in the apoplast than on the leaf surface under the conditions tested. These findings contribute to a coherent model of the adaptations of this widespread bacterial phytopathogen to distinct habitats within its host.},

              interest' (POI) library, consists of 10,368 independent mutants
              gridded into 96-well plates. By replica plating onto selective

              mutants, also stored in 96-well plates, with approximately 200
              individuals per well. The MOI library was sequenced on the
              Illumina MiSeq platform using Transposon-Directed Insertion site
              Sequencing (TraDIS) to map insertion sites onto the Psa genome. A
              grid-based PCR method was developed to recover individual

              successfully screened for a putative LPS mutant not identified in
              the visual screen. The Psa chromosome and plasmid had 24,031 and
              1,236 independent insertion events respectively, giving insertion
              frequencies of 3.65 and 16.6 per kb respectively. These data

              theoretical probability of finding an insert in any one
              chromosomal gene estimated to be 97.5\%. However, only 47\% of
              chromosomal genes had insertions. This surprisingly low rate
              cannot be solely explained by the lack of insertions in essential
              genes, which would be expected to be around 5\%. Strikingly, many
              accessory genes, including most of those encoding type III
              effectors, lacked insertions. In contrast, 94\% of genes on the
              Psa plasmid had insertions, including for example, the type III
              effector HopAU1. These results suggest that some chromosomal

We report here that this mutant also cannot use, as a sole carbon and/or energy source, a wide variety of hexoses and intermediates of hexose catabolism.

The deduced amino acid sequences of two of the three open reading frames (ORFs) present on this fragment, ORF2 and ORF3, had no significant homology with sequences in the GenBank databases. However, the 510-amino-acid sequence of ORF1, the site of the Tn5 insertion, strongly resembled the deduced amino acid sequences of the Bacillus subtilis and Zea mays genes encoding 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG)-independent phosphoglyceromutase (PGM) (52\% identity and 72\% similarity and 37\% identity and 57\% similarity, respectively). PGMs not requiring the cofactor DPG are usually found in plants and algae. Enzyme assays confirmed that P. syringae PGM activity required an intact ORF1. Not only is DC3481 the first PGM-deficient pseudomonad mutant to be described, but the P. syringae pgm gene is the first gram-negative bacterial gene identified that appears to code for a DPG-independent PGM.

              siderophores",
  author   = "C{\'e}zard, C and Farvacques, N and Sonnet, P",
  abstract = "Pyoverdine is the generic name given to a vast family of
              fluorescent green-yellowish pigments produced by Pseudomonas
              species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen,
              particularly infecting humans with compromised natural defenses.
              These infections result in significantly higher morbidity, longer
              hospitalization, increased mortality rates and excess health care
              costs. P. aeruginosa is very difficult to eradicate because of an
              intrinsic coupled with an adaptive resistance to a wide variety
              of classical antibiotics. When subjected to iron starvation
              conditions, Pseudomonas bacteria synthesize pyoverdines, their
              primary siderophores, to acquire iron from the extracellular
              medium. These molecules are not only powerful iron(III)
              scavengers but efficient iron(III) transporters as well. Three
              distinct structural parts constitute pyoverdines, i.e. (i) the
              fluorescent chromophore, deriving from a dihydroxyquinoline,
              attached via its carbonyl group to (ii) a type-specific peptide
              composed of 6 to 14 amino acids and (iii) a small side chain
              corresponding to a carboxylic acid derivative. Their chemical
              structure show three bidentate chelating sites including a
              catechol and two hydroxamates, leading to an octahedral geometry
              when complexed to iron(III). While the chromophore group is
              common to all pyoverdines, their peptide moiety differs among
              strains and species by the number, length, composition and
              configuration of amino acids. Following chelation with iron(III),
              the newly formed pyoverdine-Fe complex is recognized by a
              specific outer membrane transporter, namely FpvA, and reenters
              the cell where the iron is released from the pyoverdine into the
              periplasm for further incorporation into bacterial proteins. The
              remaining apo-pyoverdine is then recycled and secreted back to
              the extracellular medium by efflux pumps. Besides, the role of
              pyoverdines in P. aeruginosa is not only limited to scavenge iron
              from the bacterial environment. Indeed, these siderophores act as
              signal molecules for the production of acute virulence factors
              and are involved in biofilm formation as well. The ongoing
              expanding pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa has become a major
              public health problem, and finding alternative strategies to
              classical antibiotics is urgently needed. Pyoverdines along with
              the iron pathway recently gained interest among academical
              researchers as potential new approaches to ``fight'' the
              bacteria. This review describes the classification of the nearly
              60 pyoverdines identified so far, their structural and chemical
              properties and their (bio)synthesis. The different mechanisms
              underlying the steps of a pyoverdine's life in Pseudomonas are
              detailed as well: the affinity by which a pyoverdine chelates
              iron(III), the description of the interactions inducing the
              siderophore-receptor recognition, the specific transport of the
              pyoverdine-Fe(III) complex. As pyoverdine production and severe
              infections are linked, we will also report on situations where
              pyoverdines are considered as being P. aeruginosa Achilles heel:
              the propensity of FpvA to transport exo-pyoverdines, organic
              synthesis of pyoverdines and analogs, grafting of antibiotics on
              pyoverdines in a Trojan Horse strategy.",

    abstractNote={A genetically tractable model plant pathosystem, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 on tomato and Arabidopsis thaliana hosts, was used to investigate the role of salicylic acid (SA) and iron acquisition via siderophores in bacterial virulence. Pathogen-induced SA accumulation mediates defense in these plants, and DC3000 contains the genes required for the synthesis of SA, the SA-incorporated siderophore yersiniabactin (Ybt), and the fluorescent siderophore pyoverdin (Pvd). We found that DC3000 synthesizes SA, Ybt, and Pvd under iron-limiting conditions in culture. Synthesis of SA and Ybt by DC3000 requires pchA, an isochorismate synthase gene in the Ybt genomic cluster, and exogenous SA can restore Ybt production by the pchA mutant. Ybt was also produced by DC3000 in planta, suggesting that Ybt plays a role in DC3000 pathogenesis. However, the pchA mutant did not exhibit any growth defect or altered virulence in plants. This lack of phenotype was not attributable to plant-produced SA restoring Ybt production, as the pchA mutant grew similarly to DC3000 in an Arabidopsis SA biosynthetic mutant, and in planta Ybt was not detected in pchA-infected wild-type plants. In culture, no growth defect was observed for the pchA mutant versus DC3000 for any condition tested. Instead, enhanced growth of the pchA mutant was observed under stringent iron limitation and additional stresses. This suggests that SA and Ybt production by DC3000 is costly and that Pvd is sufficient for iron acquisition. Further exploration of the comparative synthesis and utility of Ybt versus Pvd production by DC3000 found siderophore-dependent amplification of ybt gene expression to be absent, suggesting that Ybt may play a yet unknown role in DC3000 pathogenesis.},

Gene expression profiles for these two bacterial species were similar under high and low iron growth conditions irrespective of growth phase. Growth in low iron led to reduced expression of genes encoding most respiratory metabolic systems and proteins of putative function, such as NADH-dehydrogenases, cytochrome oxidases, and ATP-synthases. In contrast, genes encoding siderophore-mediated iron transport, heme-hemin receptors, and a variety of metabolic enzymes for alternative metabolism were induced under low iron conditions. The overall gene expression profiles suggest that B. pseudomallei and B. mallei are able to adapt to the iron-restricted conditions in the host environment by up-regulating an iron-acquisition system and by using alternative metabolic pathways for energy production. The observations relative to the induction of specific metabolic enzymes during bacterial growth under low iron conditions warrants further experimentation.},

	title={Differential expression of multiple terminal oxidases for aerobic respiration in \textit{Pseudomonas aeruginosa}},
    volume={12},
    ISSN={1462-2912},
    abstractNote={Pseudomonas aeruginosa has five terminal oxidases for aerobic respiration. Two of them, the bo(3) oxidase (Cyo) and the cyanide-insensitive oxidase (CIO), are quinol oxidases and the other three, the cbb(3)-1 oxidase (Cbb3-1), the cbb(3)-2 oxidase (Cbb3-2) and the aa(3) oxidase (Aa3), are cytochrome c oxidases. The expression pattern of the genes for these terminal oxidases under various growth conditions was investigated by using lacZ transcriptional fusions and some novel regulatory issues were found. The Aa3 genes were induced under starvation conditions. The Cyo genes were induced by exposure to the nitric oxide-generating reagent S-nitrosoglutathione. The CIO genes were induced by exposure to sodium nitroprusside as well as cyanide. The stationary phase sigma factor RpoS was found to be involved in the expression of the Aa3 and CIO genes. The role of two redox-responsive transcriptional regulators, ANR and RoxSR, was investigated using the anr and roxSR mutant strains. The ANR was involved in the repression of the CIO genes and induction of the Cbb3-2 genes. The other three terminal oxidase genes were not significantly regulated by ANR. On the other hand, all five terminal oxidase genes were shown to be directly or indirectly regulated by RoxSR. The Aa3 genes were repressed but the genes for the other four enzymes were induced by RoxSR. The transcriptome data also showed that some respiration-related genes were regulated by RoxSR, suggesting that this two-component regulatory system plays an important role in the regulation of respiration in P. aeruginosa.},

To examine the effect of the background biochemical network on the evolvability of environmental bacteria hosting a new catabolic pathway, Akkaya and colleagues (mBio 9:e01512-18, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.01512-18) introduced the still-evolving 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT) pathway genes from the original environmental Burkholderia sp. isolate into the genome of Pseudomonas putida KT2440. They show that the mutagenic effect of 2,4-DNT oxidation, which is associated with the accumulation of ROS and oxidative damage on DNA, can be avoided by preserving high NADPH levels in P. putida The observations of this study highlight the impact of the cellular redox status of bacteria on the evolvability of new metabolic pathways.},

     volume={15}, ISSN={1462-2912},
    abstractNote={Glucose catabolism of Pseudomonas putida is carried out exclusively through the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway due to the absence of 6-phosphofructokinase. In order to activate the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) route we transferred the pfkA gene from Escherichia coli to a P. putida wild-type strain as well as to an eda mutant, i.e. lacking 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase. PfkA(E. coli) failed to redirect the carbon flow from the ED route towards the EMP pathway, suggesting that ED was essential for sugar catabolism. The presence of PfkA(E. coli) was detrimental for growth, which could be traced to the reduction of ATP and NAD(P)H pools along with alteration of the NAD(P)H/NADP(+) ratio. Pseudomonas putida cells carrying PfkA(E. coli) became highly sensitive to diamide and hydrogen peroxide, the response to which is very demanding of NADPH. The inhibitory effect of PfkA(E. coli) could in part be relieved by methionine, the synthesis of which relies much on NADPH. These results expose the role of the ED pathway for generating the redox currency (NADPH) that is required for counteracting oxidative stress. It is thus likely that environmental bacteria that favour the ED pathway over the EMP pathway do so in order to gear their aerobic metabolism to endure oxidative-related insults.},

    abstractNote={During the past decade significant progress has been made towards identifying some of the schemes that Pseudomonas aeruginosa uses to obtain iron and towards cataloguing and characterizing many of the genes and gene products that are likely to play a role in these processes. This review will largely recount what we have learned in the past few years about how P. aeruginosa regulates its acquisition, intake and, to some extent, trafficking of iron, and the role of iron acquisition systems in the virulence of this remarkable opportunistic pathogen. More specifically, the genetics, biochemistry and biology of an essential regulator (Ferric uptake regulator - Fur) and a Fur-regulated alternative sigma factor (PvdS), which are central to these processes, will be discussed. These regulatory proteins directly or indirectly regulate a substantial number of other genes encoding proteins with remarkably diverse functions. These genes include: (i) other regulatory genes, (ii) genes involved in basic metabolic processes (e.g. Krebs cycle), (iii) genes required to survive oxidative stress (e.g. superoxide dismutase), (iv) genes necessary for scavenging iron (e.g. siderophores and their cognate receptors) or genes that contribute to the virulence (e.g. exotoxin A) of this opportunistic pathogen. Despite this recent expansion of knowledge about the response of P. aeruginosa to iron, many significant biological issues surrounding iron acquisition still need to be addressed. Virtually nothing is known about which of the distinct iron acquisition mechanisms P. aeruginosa brings to bear on these questions outside the laboratory, whether it be in soil, in a pipeline, on plants or in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients.},

    ISSN={0021-9193},
    abstractNote={The alternative sigma factor AlgU (Pseudomonas aeruginosa sigma E) is required for full resistance of P. aeruginosa to oxidative stress and extreme temperatures. AlgU also controls conversion of P. aeruginosa to the mucoid, alginate-overproducing phenotype associated with lethal infections in cystic fibrosis patients. Mutations that cause conversion to mucoidy in cystic fibrosis isolates occur frequently in mucA, the second gene within the algU mucABCD gene cluster. Here we analyze the biochemical basis of conversion to mucoidy. MucA was shown to act as an anti-sigma factor by binding to AlgU and inhibiting its activity. MucB, another negative regulator of AlgU, was localized in the periplasm. MucB exerts its function from this compartment, since deletion of the leader peptide and the cytoplasmic location of MucB abrogated its ability to inhibit mucoidy. These data support a model in which a multicomponent system, encompassing an anti-delta factor and elements in the periplasmic compartment, modulates activity of AlgU. Since factors controlling AlgU are conserved in other gram-negative bacteria, the processes controlling conversion to mucoidy in P. aeruginosa may be applicable to the regulation of AlgU (sigma E) equivalents in other organisms.},

 volume={154},

 abstractNote={The phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea produces the exopolysaccharide (EPS) alginate, which is thought to function in epiphytic fitness and virulence. A key regulator for alginate biosynthesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. syringae is the alternative sigma factor AlgT (sigma(22)). In this study, the contribution of alginate synthesis and AlgT to in planta epiphytic fitness and virulence of P. syringae was examined. Alginate biosynthesis mutants were generated for the P. syringae pv. glycinea strains PG4180 and PG4180.muc, representing a comprehensive set of alginate- and AlgT-positive or -negative derivatives. Analysis of in vitro and in planta phenotypes revealed that AlgT strongly promoted in planta growth, survival and symptom development, but decreased the ability to grow in vitro. In contrast, alginate biosynthesis had only marginal impact. Quantitative in vitro and in planta gene expression analyses for alginate biosynthesis and algT were carried out at two temperatures in AlgT-negative and -positive backgrounds. algT as well as algD gene expression was AlgT-dependent, plant-inducible and temperature-dependent, with higher expression at 18 compared to 28 degrees C; however, no temperature dependence was observed in vitro. Our data suggest that AlgT may act as a global regulator for virulence and in planta fitness traits of P. syringae independent of its role in EPS biosynthesis.},

One of the key regulatory genes controlling alginate biosynthesis in P. aeruginosa is algT, which encodes the alternate sigma factor, sigma(22). In the present study, the algT gene product from P. syringae pv. syringae showed 90\% amino acid identity with its P. aeruginosa counterpart, and sequence analysis of the region flanking algT in P. syringae revealed the presence of nadB, mucA, and mucB in an arrangement virtually identical to that of P. aeruginosa. An algT mutant of P. syringae was defective in alginate production but could be complemented with wild-type algT from P. syringae or P. aeruginosa when expressed in trans. The algT mutant also displayed increased sensitivity to heat, paraquat, and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)); the latter two compounds are known to generate reactive oxygen intermediates. Signals for activation of algT gene expression in P. syringae were investigated with an algT::uidA transcriptional fusion. Like that in P. aeruginosa, algT transcription in P. syringae was activated by heat shock. However, algT expression in P. syringae was also stimulated by osmotic stress and by exposure to paraquat, H(2)O(2), and copper sulfate. The latter two compounds are frequently encountered during colonization of plant tissue and may be unique signals for algT activation in P. syringae.}, number={23}, journal={Journal of bacteriology},

    volume={33},
    ISSN={0950-382X},
    abstractNote={The Pseudomonas aeruginosa algD gene is the first gene of an operon encoding most of the enzymes necessary for biosynthesis of the exopolysaccharide alginate. Transcriptional activation of algD results in the high-level synthesis of alginate, an important P. aeruginosa virulence factor with antiphagocytic and adherence properties. Previously, we have identified a protein(s), AlgZ, expressed in mucoid P. aeruginosa CF isolates that specifically bound to sequences located 280 bp upstream of the algD promoter. Mutagenesis of the AlgZ DNA binding site and transcription assays were used to show that AlgZ was an activator of algD transcription. In the current study, the monomeric size of AlgZ was estimated to be between 6 kDa and 15 kDa by electroelution of a protein preparation from an SDS-PAGE gel and analysis of the fractions via protein staining and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. A biochemical enrichment procedure, resulting in a 130-fold enrichment for AlgZ, was devised, the protein identified and a partial amino-terminal sequence obtained. Using the P. aeruginosa Genome Project database, a complete sequence was obtained, and algZ was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Expression of algZ was sufficient for the observed AlgZ DNA binding previously observed from extracts of P. aeruginosa. A protein database search revealed that AlgZ is homologous to the Mnt and Arc repressors of the ribbon-helix-helix family of DNA-binding proteins. An algZ deletion mutant was constructed in the mucoid CF isolate FRD1. The resulting strain was non-mucoid and exhibited no detectable algD transcription. As an indirect role in transcription would probably result in some residual algD transcription, these data suggest that AlgZ is an integral activator of algD and support the hypothesis that both AlgZ and the response regulator AlgR are involved in direct contact with RNA polymerase containing the alternative sigma factor, AlgT. The cloning of algZ is a crucial step in determining the mechanism of algD activation.}, number={5},

However, despite the fact that components of this pathway are known, their physiological roles have not yet been established. Regarding the CsrA/RsmA type proteins, five paralogs, three of which are well conserved within the Pseudomonas genus (csrA1, csrA2, and csrA3), have been found in the DC3000 genome. To decipher their function, mutants lacking the three most conserved CsrA proteins have been constructed and their physiological outcomes examined. We show that they exert nonredundant functions and demonstrate that CsrA3 and, to a lesser extent, CsrA2 but not CsrA1 alter the expression of genes involved in a variety of pathways and systems important for motility, exopolysaccharide synthesis, growth, and virulence. Particularly, alginate synthesis, syringafactin production, and virulence are considerably de-repressed in a csrA3 mutant, whereas growth in planta is impaired. We propose that the linkage of growth and symptom development is under the control of CsrA3, which functions as a pivotal regulator of the DC3000 life cycle, repressing virulence traits and promoting cell division in response to environmental cues.},

    abstractNote={Random Tn5 mutagenesis was used to identify genes ir. Pseudomonas syringae which contribute to epiphytic fitness. Mutants were selected on the basis of deficiencies in epiphytic growth or survival on plants rather than deficiencies in predetermined phenotypes exhibited in culture. A sample freezing procedure was used to measure the population sizes of 5,300 mutants of P. syringae exposed to alternating wet and dry conditions on bean leaves in growth chambers. Eighty-two mutants exhibited reduced population sizes. Of these mutants, over half exhibited a reduced ability to survive the stresses associated with dry leaves, while others grew more slowly or attained reduced stationary-phase population sizes on leaves. While some epiphytic fitness mutants were altered in phenotypes that could be measured in culture, many mutants were not altered in any in vitro phenotype examined. Only three of the epiphytic fitness mutants were auxotrophs, and none had catabolic deficiencies for any of 31 organic compounds tested. Other mutants that exhibited reductions in one or more of the following were identified: motility, osmotolerance, desiccation tolerance, growth rate in batch culture, and extracellular polysaccharide production.

Little is known about the genetic features of this pathovar. We generated genome-wide Illumina sequence data from two Psa strains causing outbreaks of bacterial canker on the A. deliciosa cv. Hayward in Japan (J-Psa, type-strain of the pathovar) and in Italy (I-Psa) in 1984 and 1992, respectively as well as from a Psa strain (I2-Psa) isolated at the beginning of the recent epidemic on A. chinensis cv. Hort16A in Italy. All strains were isolated from typical leaf spot symptoms. The phylogenetic relationships revealed that Psa is more closely related to P. s. pv. theae than to P. avellanae within genomospecies 8. Comparative genomic analyses revealed both relevant intrapathovar variations and putative pathovar-specific genomic regions in Psa. The genomic sequences of J-Psa and I-Psa were very similar. Conversely, the I2-Psa genome encodes four additional effector protein genes, lacks a 50 kb plasmid and the phaseolotoxin gene cluster, argK-tox but has acquired a 160 kb plasmid and putative prophage sequences. Several lines of evidence from the analysis of the genome sequences support the hypothesis that this strain did not evolve from the Psa population that caused the epidemics in 1984-1992 in Japan and Italy but rather is the product of a recent independent evolution of the pathovar actinidiae for infecting Actinidia spp. All Psa strains share the genetic potential for copper resistance, antibiotic detoxification, high affinity iron acquisition and detoxification of nitric oxide of plant origin. Similar to other sequenced phytopathogenic pseudomonads associated with woody plant species, the Psa strains isolated from leaves also display a set of genes involved in the catabolism of plant-derived aromatic compounds.},

To overcome this barrier, bacteria have developed several systems for protein secretion. The type V secretion pathway encompasses the autotransporter proteins, the two-partner secretion system, and the recently described type Vc or AT-2 family of proteins. Since its discovery in the late 1980s, this family of secreted proteins has expanded continuously, due largely to the advent of the genomic age, to become the largest group of secreted proteins in gram-negative bacteria. Several of these proteins play essential roles in the pathogenesis of bacterial infections and have been characterized in detail, demonstrating a diverse array of function including the ability to condense host cell actin and to modulate apoptosis. However, most of the autotransporter proteins remain to be characterized. In light of new discoveries and controversies in this research field, this review considers the autotransporter secretion process in the context of the more general field of bacterial protein translocation and exoprotein function.},

    abstractNote={The hrp genes of Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola control the development of primary disease symptoms in bean plants and the elicitation of the hypersensitive response in resistant plants. We examined the expression of the seven operons located in the 22-kb hrp cluster (L. G. Rahme, M. N. Mindrinos, and N. J. Panopoulos, J. Bacteriol. 173:575-586, 1991) in planta and in vitro under different physiological and nutritional conditions by using chromosomally located hrp::inaZ reporter fusions. We show that (i) a plant signal(s) is specifically required for the induction of the seven hrp operons, during both compatible and incompatible interactions; (ii) hrpL and hrpRS are regulated by different mechanisms in planta and in vitro; and (iii) expression of individual hrp loci is differentially affected by pH, osmotic strength, and type of carbon source: hrpAB, hrpC, and hrpD were downregulated similarly by osmolarity, pH, and certain carbon sources; hrpE expression was affected strongly by pH and carbon substrate and slightly by osmolarity; and hrpF was not substantially affected by any of these factors. These findings suggest complex signaling mechanisms taking place during plant-pathogen interactions.},

    volume={39},
    ISSN={0140-7791},
    abstractNote={The apoplast is the arena in which endophytic pathogens such as Pseudomonas syringae grow and interact with plant cells. Using metabolomic and ion analysis techniques, this study shows how the composition of Phaseolus vulgaris leaf apoplastic fluid changes during the first six hours of compatible and incompatible interactions with two strains of P. syringae pv. phaseolicola (Pph) that differ in the presence of the genomic island PPHGI-1. Leaf inoculation with the avirulent island-carrying strain Pph 1302A elicited effector-triggered immunity (ETI) and resulted in specific changes in apoplast composition, including increases in conductivity, pH, citrate, Î³-aminobutyrate (GABA) and K(+) , that are linked to the onset of plant defence responses. Other apoplastic changes, including increases in Ca(2+) , Fe(2/3+) Mg(2+) , sucrose, Î²-cyanoalanine and several amino acids, occurred to a relatively similar extent in interactions with both Pph 1302A and the virulent, island-less strain Pph RJ3. Metabolic footprinting experiments established that Pph preferentially metabolizes malate, glucose and glutamate, but excludes certain other abundant apoplastic metabolites, including citrate and GABA, until preferred metabolites are depleted. These results demonstrate that Pph is well-adapted to the leaf apoplast metabolic environment and that loss of PPHGI-1 enables Pph to avoid changes in apoplast composition linked to plant defences.},

    volume={9},
    ISSN={1471-2180},
    abstractNote={BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola is a Gram-negative plant-pathogenic bacterium that causes âhalo blightâ disease of beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). This disease affects both foliage and pods, and is a major problem in temperate areas of the world. Although several bacterial genes have been determined as participants in pathogenesis, the overall process still remains poorly understood, mainly because the identity and function of many of the genes are largely unknown. In this work, a genomic library of P. syringae pv. phaseolicola NPS3121 was constructed and PCR amplification of individual fragments was carried out in order to print a DNA microarray. This microarray was used to identify genes that are differentially expressed when bean leaf extracts, pod extracts or apoplastic fluid were added to the growth medium. RESULTS: Transcription profiles show that 224 genes were differentially expressed, the majority under the effect of bean leaf extract and apoplastic fluid. Some of the induced genes were previously known to be involved in the first stages of the bacterial-plant interaction and virulence. These include genes encoding type III secretion system proteins and genes involved in cell-wall degradation, phaseolotoxin synthesis and aerobic metabolism. On the other hand, most repressed genes were found to be involved in the uptake and metabolism of iron. CONCLUSION: This study furthers the understanding of the mechanisms involved, responses and the metabolic adaptation that occurs during the interaction of P. syringae pv. phaseolicola with a susceptible host plant.},

              infection for hemibiotrophic pathogens such as P. syringae, which
              obtain nutrients directly from apoplastic fluid. We have used
              apoplastic fluid extracted from healthy tomato leaves as a growth
              medium for Pseudomonas spp. in order to investigate the role of
              apoplastic nutrients in plant colonization by Pseudomonas

              the environmental and nutritional conditions that bacteria
              encounter during apoplast colonization by demonstrating that
              expression of the plant-induced type III protein secretion
              pathway is upregulated during bacterial growth in apoplast

              apoplast-adapted P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 expresses nutrient
              utilization pathways that allow it to use sugars, organic acids,
