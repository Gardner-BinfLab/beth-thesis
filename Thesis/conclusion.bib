              eukaryotic miRNAs are more heterogeneous in length, sequence
              composition, and secondary structure. The vast majority of sRNAs
              function post-transcriptionally by binding to other RNAs (mRNAs,
              sRNAs) through rather short regions of imperfect sequence
              complementarity. Besides, every single sRNA may interact with
              dozens of different target RNAs and impact gene expression either
              negatively or positively. These facts contributed to the view
              that the entirety of the regulatory targets of a given sRNA, its
              targetome, is challenging to identify. However, recent
              developments show that a more comprehensive sRNA's targetome can
              be achieved through the combination of experimental and
              computational approaches. Here, we give a short introduction into
              these methods followed by a description of two sRNAs, RyhB and
              RsaA, to illustrate the particular strengths and weaknesses of
              these approaches in more detail. RyhB is an sRNA involved in iron

              the evolution of life and the RNA repertoires of extant lineages.
              Some assessments seem consistent with a diverse RNA world, yet
              direct continuity between modern RNAs and an RNA world has not
              been demonstrated for the majority of RNA families, and,
              anecdotally, many RNA functions appear restricted in their
              distribution. Despite much discussion of the possible antiquity
              of RNA families, no systematic analyses of RNA family
              distribution have been performed. To chart the broad evolutionary
              history of known RNA families, we performed comparative genomic
              analysis of over 3 million RNA annotations spanning 1446 families
              from the Rfam 10 database. We report that 99\% of known RNA

              discrete repertoires for each domain. For the 1\% of RNA
              families/clans present in more than one domain, over half show

              de novo identification. The emergence of new technologies for

              improving noncoding RNA identification and expression

              establish whether annotation of existing transcriptome data has
              effectively captured all functional outputs, we analysed over 400
              publicly available RNA-seq datasets spanning 37 different Archaea

              roles in many biological processes such as gene regulation,
              signaling, RNA processing, and protein synthesis. Among the most
              common groups of ncRNAs in bacteria are riboswitches. These
              cis-regulatory, metabolite-binding RNAs are present in many
              species where they regulate various metabolic and signaling
              pathways. Collectively, there are likely to be hundreds of novel
              riboswitch classes that remain hidden in the bacterial genomes
              that have already been sequenced, and potentially thousands of
              classes distributed among various other species in the biosphere.
              The vast majority of these undiscovered classes are proposed to
              be exceedingly rare, and so current bioinformatics search
              techniques are reaching their limits for differentiating between
              true riboswitch candidates and false positives. RESULTS: Herein,
              we exploit a computational search pipeline that can efficiently
              identify intergenic regions most likely to encode structured
              ncRNAs. Application of this method to five bacterial genomes
              yielded nearly 70 novel genetic elements including 30 novel
              candidate ncRNA motifs. Among the riboswitch candidates
              identified is an RNA motif involved in the regulation of thiamin

              existing classification schemes have led to significant

              transposition mechanisms and structural features: the
              retrotransposons (class I) and the DNA transposons (class II). We

              annotation in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic scientific
              communities have changed over time. This has led us to observe
              that: (1) a number of TEs have convergent structural features

              conclusions regarding their classification, (2) the evolution of
              TEs is similar to that of viruses by having several unrelated
              origins, (3) there might be at least 8 classes and 12 orders of
              TEs including 10 novel orders. In an effort to address these

  author   = "Partridge, Sally R and Tsafnat, Guy",
  abstract = "Background: Multiresistance in Gram-negative bacteria is often
              due to acquisition of several different antibiotic resistance
              genes, each associated with a different mobile genetic element,
              that tend to cluster together in complex conglomerations.
              Accurate, consistent annotation of resistance genes, the
              boundaries and fragments of mobile elements, and signatures of
              insertion, such as DR, facilitates comparative analysis of
              complex multiresistance regions and plasmids to better understand
              their evolution and how resistance genes spread. Objectives: To
              extend the Repository of Antibiotic resistance Cassettes (RAC)
              web site, which includes a database of 'features', and the
              Attacca automatic DNA annotation system, to encompass additional
              resistance genes and all types of associated mobile elements.
              Methods: Antibiotic resistance genes and mobile elements were
              added to RAC, from existing registries where possible. Attacca
              grammars were extended to accommodate the expanded database, to
              allow overlapping features to be annotated and to identify and
              annotate features such as composite transposons and DR. Results:
              The Multiple Antibiotic Resistance Annotator (MARA) database
              includes antibiotic resistance genes and selected mobile elements
              from Gram-negative bacteria, distinguishing important variants.
              Sequences can be submitted to the MARA web site for annotation. A
              list of positions and orientations of annotated features,
              indicating those that are truncated, DR and potential composite
              transposons is provided for each sequence, as well as a diagram
              showing annotated features approximately to scale. Conclusions:
              The MARA web site (http://mara.spokade.com) provides a
              comprehensive database for mobile antibiotic resistance in
              Gram-negative bacteria and accurately annotates resistance genes

              more efficient, more visually appealing and much more user
              friendly. In particular, PHASTER is now 4.3$\times$ faster than
              PHAST when analyzing a typical bacterial genome. More
              specifically, software optimizations have made the backend of
              PHASTER 2.7X faster than PHAST, while the addition of 80 CPUs to
              the PHASTER compute cluster are responsible for the remaining

              min from the raw sequence alone, or in 1.5 min when given a
              pre-annotated GenBank file. A number of other optimizations have

              known as drivers of genome evolution. Their impacts have been
              widely studied in animals, plants and insects, but little is
              known about them in microalgae. In a previous study, we compared
              the genetic polymorphisms between strains of the haptophyte
              microalga Tisochrysis lutea and suggested the involvement of
              active autonomous TEs in their genome evolution. RESULTS: To
              identify potentially autonomous TEs, we designed a pipeline named
              PiRATE (Pipeline to Retrieve and Annotate Transposable Elements,
              download: https://doi.org/10.17882/51795 ), and conducted an
              accurate TE annotation on a new genome assembly of T. lutea.
              PiRATE is composed of detection, classification and annotation
              steps. Its detection step combines multiple, existing analysis
              packages representing all major approaches for TE detection and
              its classification step was optimized for microalgal genomes. The
              efficiency of the detection and classification steps was
              evaluated with data on the model species Arabidopsis thaliana.
              PiRATE detected 81\% of the TE families of A. thaliana and
              correctly classified 75\% of them. We applied PiRATE to T. lutea
              genomic data and established that its genome contains 15.89\%
              Class I and 4.95\% Class II TEs. In these, 3.79 and 17.05\%
              correspond to potentially autonomous and non-autonomous TEs,
              respectively. Annotation data was combined with transcriptomic
              and proteomic data to identify potentially active autonomous TEs.
              We identified 17 expressed TE families and, among these, a
              TIR/Mariner and a TIR/hAT family were able to synthesize their
              transposase. Both these TE families were among the three highest
              expressed genes in a previous transcriptomic study and are
              composed of highly similar copies throughout the genome of T.
              lutea. This sum of evidence reveals that both these TE families
              could be capable of transposing or triggering the transposition

              provides an example of a de novo transposable element annotation

              assembly and belonging to a poorly studied phylum at genomic
              level. Integration of multi-omics data enabled the discovery of
              potential mobile TEs and opens the way for new discoveries on the

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The class of small non-coding RNA molecules (sRNA)
              regulates gene expression by different mechanisms and enables
              bacteria to mount a physiological response due to adaptation to
              the environment or infection. Over the last decades the number of
              sRNAs has been increasing rapidly. Several databases like Rfam or
              fRNAdb were extended to include sRNAs as a class of its own.
              Furthermore new specialized databases like sRNAMap (gram-negative
              bacteria only) and sRNATarBase (target prediction) were
              established. To the best of the authors' knowledge no database
              focusing on sRNAs from gram-positive bacteria is publicly
              available so far. DESCRIPTION: In order to understand sRNA's
              functional and phylogenetic relationships we have developed
              sRNAdb and provide tools for data analysis and visualization. The
              data compiled in our database is assembled from experiments as
              well as from bioinformatics analyses. The software enables
              comparison and visualization of gene loci surrounding the sRNAs
              of interest. To accomplish this, we use a client-server based
              approach. Offline versions of the database including analyses and
              visualization tools can easily be installed locally on the user's
              computer. This feature facilitates customized local addition of
              unpublished sRNA candidates and related information such as
              promoters or terminators using tab-delimited files. CONCLUSION:
              sRNAdb allows a user-friendly and comprehensive comparative
              analysis of sRNAs from available sequenced gram-positive
              prokaryotic replicons. Offline versions including analysis and
