              bacteria and some archaea. Hfq binds small regulatory RNAs
              (sRNAs), facilitates base pairing between sRNAs and their mRNA
              targets, and directly binds and regulates translation of certain
              mRNAs. Because sRNAs regulate many stress response pathways in
              bacteria, Hfq is essential for adaptation to different
              environments and growth conditions. The chaperone activities of
              Hfq arise from multipronged RNA binding by three different
              surfaces of the Hfq hexamer. The manner in which the structured
              Sm core of Hfq binds RNA has been well studied, but recent work

              central carbon flux, biofilm formation and motility in E. coli.
              CsrC antagonizes the regulatory effects of CsrA, presumably by

              in that a similar sRNA, CsrB, performs essentially the same

              A variety of approaches have been used previously to identify 44
              sRNAs in the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
              In this work, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is used to identify novel
              transcripts in P.aeruginosa involving a combination of three
              different sequencing libraries. Almost all known sRNAs and over
              500 novel intergenic sRNAs are identified with this approach.
              Although the use of three libraries increased the number of novel
              transcripts identified, there were significant differences in the
              subset of transcripts detected in each library, underscoring the

              about their evolution. Here we compile what has been studied to
              date and trace a life cycle of sRNAs-from their mechanisms of
              emergence, through processes of change and frequent
              neofunctionalization, to their loss from bacterial lineages.
              Because they possess relatively unrestrictive structural
              requirements, we find that sRNA origins are varied, and include
              de novo emergence as well as formation from preexisting genetic
              elements via duplication events and horizontal gene transfer. The
              need for only partial complementarity to their mRNA targets

              significant challenges in tracing sRNAs across broad evolutionary

  abstract = "Emerging high-throughput technologies have led to a deluge of
              putative non-coding RNA (ncRNA) sequences identified in a wide
              variety of organisms. Systematic characterization of these
              transcripts will be a tremendous challenge. Homology detection is
              critical to making maximal use of functional information gathered
              about ncRNAs: identifying homologous sequence allows us to
              transfer information gathered in one organism to another quickly
              and with a high degree of confidence. ncRNA presents a challenge
              for homology detection, as the primary sequence is often poorly
              conserved and de novo secondary structure prediction and search
              remain difficult. This unit introduces methods developed by the
              Rfam database for identifying ``families'' of homologous ncRNAs
              starting from single ``seed'' sequences, using manually curated
              sequence alignments to build powerful statistical models of
              sequence and structure conservation known as covariance models

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Profile hidden Markov models (profile-HMMs) are
              sensitive tools for remote protein homology detection, but the
              main scoring algorithms, Viterbi or Forward, require considerable
              time to search large sequence databases. RESULTS: We have
              designed a series of database filtering steps, HMMERHEAD, that
              are applied prior to the scoring algorithms, as implemented in
              the HMMER package, in an effort to reduce search time. Using this
              heuristic, we obtain a 20-fold decrease in Forward and a 6-fold
              decrease in Viterbi search time with a minimal loss in
              sensitivity relative to the unfiltered approaches. We then
              implemented an iterative profile-HMM search method, JackHMMER,
              which employs the HMMERHEAD heuristic. Due to our search
              heuristic, we eliminated the subdatabase creation that is common
              in current iterative profile-HMM approaches. On our benchmark,
              JackHMMER detects 14\% more remote protein homologs than SAM's
              iterative method T2K. CONCLUSIONS: Our search heuristic,
              HMMERHEAD, significantly reduces the time needed to score a
              profile-HMM against large sequence databases. This search
              heuristic allowed us to implement an iterative profile-HMM search
              method, JackHMMER, which detects significantly more remote

              important role in regulating gene expression. In most cases,
              transcription attenuation is used as a regulatory mechanism that
              allows the cell to adjust protein synthesis levels in response to
              a specific signal. Here, by using a tRNA gene as a

              transcription attenuation mechanism in Escherichia coli that
              involves bacterial interspersed mosaic elements (BIMEs), the main
              family of repetitive extragenic elements. The transcription
              termination factor Rho is required for attenuation in association

              BIMEs-dependent global regulator of gene expression. By
              mutational analyses, we identified nucleotide determinants of
              BIMEs that are required for attenuation and showed that this

              consistent with a model in which BIMEs provoke a pause in RNA

              transcription. BIME-dependent transcription attenuation may be
              used as a means to differentially regulate expression of adjacent
              genes belonging to a single operon. BIMEs are dispersed in more

              gene expression. Our results suggest that RNase E, an
              endoribonuclease, initiates the degradation of REP-stabilized

              containing a REP-stabilizer poses a special challenge to the mRNA
              degradation machinery. Two enzymes, the DEAD-box RNA helicase,
              RhlB and poly(A) polymerase (PAP) are required to facilitate the
              degradation of REP-stabilizers by polynucleotide phosphorylase
              (PNPase). This is the first in vivo evidence that these enzymes
              are required for the degradation of REP-stabilizers. Furthermore,
              our results show that REP degradation by RhlB and PNPase requires
              their association with RNase E as components of the RNA
              degradosome, thus providing the first in vivo evidence that this

              coli that result in extensive stem-loop structures in their
              mRNAs. However, their physiological role has remained elusive.
              Here, we show that REP sequences can downregulate translation,
              but only if they are within 15 nt of a termination codon; a
              spacing of 16 nt has no effect, suggesting that the REP element
              acts to stall ribosome movement. Ribosome stalling leads to
              cleavage of the mRNA and induction of the trans-translation
              process. Using nrdAB as a model, we find that its regulation can
              be partially reversed by overexpression of RNA helicases and can
              be fully overcome upon UV stress, emphasizing the importance of
              this regulatory process. Since 50\% of REP-associated genes have

              in a wide range of bacteria, usually by promoting base pairing of
              mRNAs with trans-encoded sRNAs. It was previously shown that Hfq
              down-regulates Tn10 transposition by inhibiting IS10 transposase
              expression at the post-transcriptional level. This provided the
              first example of Hfq playing a role in DNA transposition and led
              us to ask if a related transposon, Tn5, is similarly regulated.
              RESULTS: We show that Hfq strongly suppresses Tn5 transposition
              in Escherichia coli by inhibiting IS50 transposase expression.
              However, in contrast to the situation for Tn10, Hfq primarily
              inhibits IS50 transposase transcription. As Hfq does not
              typically function directly in transcription, we searched for a
              transcription factor that also down-regulated IS50 transposase
              transcription and is itself under Hfq control. We show that Crp
              (cyclic AMP receptor protein) fits these criteria as: (1)
              disruption of the crp gene led to an increase in IS50 transposase

              that observed for an hfq disruption; and (2) Crp expression
              decreased in hfq (-) . We also demonstrate that IS50 transposase
              expression and Tn5 transposition are induced by over-expression
              of the sRNA SgrS and link this response to glucose limitation.
              CONCLUSIONS: Tn5 transposition is negatively regulated by Hfq
              primarily through inhibition of IS50 transposase transcription.
              Preliminary results support the possibility that this regulation
              is mediated through Crp. We also provide evidence that glucose
              limitation activates IS50 transposase transcription and
              transposition.",

              It is less clear if Hfq is required for pairing of cis-encoded
              RNAs (i.e., antisense RNAs) with their target mRNAs. In the
              current work, we have characterized the interactions between
              Escherichia coli Hfq and the components of the Tn10/IS10
              antisense system, RNA-IN and RNA-OUT. We show that Hfq interacts
              with RNA-OUT through its proximal RNA-binding surface, as is
              typical for Hfq and trans-encoded sRNAs. In contrast, RNA-IN
              binds both proximal and distal RNA-binding surfaces in Hfq with a
              higher affinity for the latter, as is typical for mRNA
              interactions in canonical sRNA-mRNA pairs. Importantly, an amino
              acid substitution in Hfq that interferes with RNA binding to the
              proximal site negatively impacts RNA-IN:OUT pairing in vitro and
              suppresses the ability of Hfq to negatively regulate IS10

              and RNA-OUT alters secondary structure elements in both of these

              facilitates RNA-IN:OUT pairing. Based on the results presented

              believed to be exclusively deleterious genomic parasites.
              However, it is now clear that they play an important role as
              bacterial mutagenic agents, enabling the host to adapt to new
              environmental challenges and to colonize new niches. This review
              focuses on the impact of insertion sequences (IS), arguably the

              adaptability of phenotypic traits, including resistance to
              antibacterial agents, virulence, pathogenicity and catabolism.
              The direct consequence of IS transposition is the insertion of
              one DNA sequence into another. This event can result in gene
              inactivation as well as in modulation of neighbouring gene
              expression. The latter is usually mediated by de-repression or by
              the introduction of a complete or partial promoter located within
              the element. Furthermore, transcription and transposition of IS

              Transcription of tisAB and istR-2 is SOS regulated, whereas

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: micF RNA, a small regulatory RNA found in bacteria,
              post-transcriptionally regulates expression of outer membrane
              protein F (OmpF) by interaction with the ompF mRNA 5'UTR.
              Phylogenetic data can be useful for RNA/RNA duplex structure
              analyses and aid in elucidation of mechanism of regulation.
              However micF and associated genes, ompF and ompC are difficult to
              annotate because of either similarities or divergences in
              nucleotide sequence. We report by using sequences that represent
              ``gene signatures'' as probes, e.g., mRNA 5'UTR sequences,
              closely related genes can be accurately located in genomic
              sequences. RESULTS: Alignment and search methods using NCBI BLAST
              programs have been used to identify micF, ompF and ompC in
              Yersinia pestis and Yersinia enterocolitica. By alignment with
              DNA sequences from other bacterial species, 5' start sites of
              genes and upstream transcriptional regulatory sites in promoter
              regions were predicted. Annotated genes from Yersinia species
              provide phylogenetic information on the micF regulatory system.
              High sequence conservation in binding sites of transcriptional
              regulatory factors are found in the promoter region upstream of
              micF and conservation in blocks of sequences as well as marked
              sequence variation is seen in segments of the micF RNA gene.
              Unexpected large differences in rates of evolution were found
              between the interacting RNA transcripts, micF RNA and the 5' UTR
              of the ompF mRNA. micF RNA/ompF mRNA 5' UTR duplex structures
              were modeled by the mfold program. Functional domains such as
              RNA/RNA interacting sites appear to display a minimum of
              evolutionary drift in sequence with the exception of a
              significant change in Y. enterocolitica micF RNA. CONCLUSIONS:
              Newly annotated Yersinia micF and ompF genes and the resultant
              RNA/RNA duplex structures add strong phylogenetic support for a
              generalized duplex model. The alignment and search approach using
              5' UTR signatures may be a model to help define other genes and
              their start sites when annotated genes are available in
              well-defined reference organisms.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Mobile elements are involved in genomic
              rearrangements and virulence acquisition, and hence, are
              important elements in bacterial genome evolution. The insertion
              of some specific Insertion Sequences had been associated with
              repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP) elements. Considering
              that there are a sufficient number of available genomes with
              described REPs, and exploiting the advantage of the traceability
              of transposition events in genomes, we decided to exhaustively
              analyze the relationship between REP sequences and mobile
              elements. RESULTS: This global multigenome study highlights the
              importance of repetitive extragenic palindromic elements as
              target sequences for transposases. The study is based on the
              analysis of the DNA regions surrounding the 981 instances of
              Insertion Sequence elements with respect to the positioning of
              REP sequences in the 19 available annotated microbial genomes
              corresponding to species of bacteria with reported REP sequences.
              This analysis has allowed the detection of the specific insertion
              into REP sequences for ISPsy8 in Pseudomonas syringae DC3000,
              ISPa11 in P. aeruginosa PA01, ISPpu9 and ISPpu10 in P. putida
              KT2440, and ISRm22 and ISRm19 in Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021
              genome. Preference for insertion in extragenic spaces with REP
              sequences has also been detected for ISPsy7 in P. syringae
              DC3000, ISRm5 in S. meliloti and ISNm1106 in Neisseria
              meningitidis MC58 and Z2491 genomes. Probably, the association
              with REP elements that we have detected analyzing genomes is only
              the tip of the iceberg, and this association could be even more
              frequent in natural isolates. CONCLUSION: Our findings
              characterize REP elements as hot spots for transposition and
              reinforce the relationship between REP sequences and genomic
              plasticity mediated by mobile elements. In addition, this study
              defines a subset of REP-recognizer transposases with high target
              selectivity that can be useful in the development of new tools

              in which cyclic AMP levels are high. We showed by using
              microarray analysis and Northern blotting that several genes are

              intracellular pathogen, Edwardsiella tarda (E. tarda) ET13
              strain, based on RNA sequencing and bioinformatic analyses. Eight
              of the 13 putative sRNAs from the ET13 strain were transcribed
              (as indicated by RT-PCR) following exposure to different
              stresses. The transcription levels of three sRNAs (EsR128, EsR139
              and EsR240) were all highly induced under these stress
              conditions. Northern blot hybridization was employed to verify
              that EsR240 was expressed in the ET13 strain under both
              logarithmic and stationary growth phases, and that it formed a
              single copy transcript in the chromosomes of the ET13 strain. The
              precise start and end points of EsR240 were determined using
              5'and 3' RACE. The conservation of EsR240 was in agreement with
              the characteristics of sRNA, as indicated by a BLAST analysis.
              Furthermore, the survival rates of EsR240 mutant were lower than
              the rates of the wild type ET13 under stress conditions. When the
              infection time was extended 4 or 6 h, the CFUs of the wild type
              bacteria increased more significantly within macrophages compared
              to the mutant. When the intra-peritoneal (i.p.) route of
              infection was used in mice, the bacterial loads of the tissues in
              the mice infected with the wild type bacteria were significantly
              higher than in the mice infected with the mutants. The virulence
              of the EsR240 mutant was 6.79-fold lower than the wild type
              bacterium based on the LD50. In addition, the IntaRNA program was
              used to predict the target genes of EsR240. Out of the top 10
              predicted target genes, 9 genes were regulated by EsR240. These
              target genes may encode FtsH protease modulator YccA, Na+ and H+

              interactions. They have a central function in the

              Hfq, an RNA-binding protein that many sRNAs act in conjunction
              with, is required for Y. pestis pathogenesis. However,
              information on how Yersinia pestis modulates the expression of
              sRNAs during infection is largely unknown. METHODOLOGY AND
              PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used RNA-seq technology to identify the
              sRNA candidates expressed from Y. pestis grown in vitro and in
              the infected lungs of mice. A total of 104 sRNAs were found,
              including 26 previously annotated sRNAs, by searching against the
              Rfam database with 78 novel sRNA candidates. Approximately 89\%
              (93/104) of these sRNAs from Y. pestis are shared with its
              ancestor Y. pseudotuberculosis. Ninety-seven percent of these
              sRNAs (101/104) are shared among more than 80 sequenced genomes
              of 135 Y. pestis strains. These 78 novel sRNAs include 62
              intergenic and 16 antisense sRNAs. Fourteen sRNAs were selected
              for verification by independent Northern blot analysis. Results
              showed that nine selected sRNA transcripts were Hfq-dependent.
              Interestingly, three novel sRNAs were identified as new members
              of the transcription factor CRP regulon. Semi-quantitative
              analysis revealed that Y. pestis from the infected lungs induced
              the expressions of six sRNAs including RyhB1, RyhB2, CyaR/RyeE,
              6S RNA, RybB and sR039 and repressed the expressions of four
              sRNAs, including CsrB, CsrC, 4.5S RNA and sR027. CONCLUSIONS AND
              SIGNIFICANCE: This study is the first attempt to subject RNA from
              Y. pestis-infected samples to direct high-throughput sequencing.
              Many novel sRNAs were identified and the expression patterns of
              relevant sRNAs in Y. pestis during in vitro growth and in vivo
              infection were revealed. The annotated sRNAs accounted for the
              most abundant sRNAs either expressed in bacteria grown in vitro
              or differentially expressed in the infected lungs. These findings
              suggested these sRNAs may have important functions in Y. pestis

              Hfq-bound RNAs in Yersinia pestis, a causative agent of plague,
              by using cross-linking immunoprecipitation coupled with deep
              sequencing (CLIP-seq) approach. We show that the Hfq binding
              density is enriched in more than 80\% mRNAs of Y. pestis and that
              Hfq also globally binds noncoding small RNAs (sRNAs) encoded by
              the intergenic, antisense, and 3' regions of mRNAs. An Hfq U-rich
              stretch is highly enriched in sRNAs, while motifs partially
              complementary to AGAAUAA and GGGGAUUA are enriched in both mRNAs

              factor that was essential for replication of the bacteriophage
              Q$\beta$, the Hfq protein is a ubiquitous and highly abundant
              RNA-binding protein in many bacteria. With the assistance of Hfq,
              small RNAs in bacteria play important roles in regulating the
              stability and translation of mRNAs by base pairing. In this
              study, we want to elucidate the Hfq-assisted sRNA-mRNA regulation

              pestis was obtained by sequencing cDNAs converted from the
              Hfq-bound RNA fragments using UV cross-linking coupled
              immunoprecipitation technology. We demonstrate that Hfq could
              bind to hundreds of sRNAs and the majority of mRNAs in Y. pestis
              The enriched binding motifs in sRNAs and mRNAs are complementary
              to each other, suggesting a general base-pairing mechanism for
              sRNA-mRNA interaction. The Hfq-bound sRNA and mRNA regions were
              both destabilized. The results suggest that Hfq binding
              facilitates sRNA-mRNA base pairing and coordinates their
              degradation, which might enable Hfq to surveil the homeostasis of
              most mRNAs in bacteria.",
