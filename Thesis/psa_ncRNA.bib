    abstractNote={To fully understand how bacteria respond to their environment, it is essential to assess genome-wide transcriptional activity. New high-throughput sequencing technologies make it possible to query the transcriptome of an organism in an efficient unbiased manner. We applied a strand-specific method to sequence bacterial transcripts using Illumina’s high-throughput sequencing technology. The resulting sequences were used to construct genome-wide transcriptional profiles. Novel bioinformatics analyses were developed and used in combination with proteomics data for the qualitative classification of transcriptional activity in defined regions. As expected, most transcriptional activity was consistent with predictions from the genome annotation. Importantly, we identified and confirmed transcriptional activity in areas of the genome inconsistent with the annotation and in unannotated regions. Further analyses revealed potential RpoN-dependent promoter sequences upstream of several noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), suggesting a role for these ncRNAs in RpoN-dependent phenotypes. We were also able to validate a number of transcriptional start sites, many of which were consistent with predicted promoter motifs. Overall, our approach provides an efficient way to survey global transcriptional activity in bacteria and enables rapid discovery of specific areas in the genome that merit further investigation.}, number={9}, journal={Journal of bacteriology}, author={Filiatrault, Melanie J. and Stodghill, Paul V. and Bronstein, Philip A. and Moll, Simon and Lindeberg, Magdalen and Grills, George and Schweitzer, Peter and Wang, Wei and Schroth, Gary P. and Luo, Shujun and et al.},

    abstractNote={BACKGROUND: Small noncoding regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) are post-transcriptional regulators, regulating mRNAs, proteins, and DNA in bacteria. One class of sRNAs, trans-acting sRNAs, are the most abundant sRNAs transcribed from the intergenic regions (IGRs) of the bacterial genome. In Streptococcus pyogenes, a common and potentially deadly pathogen, many sRNAs have been identified, but only a few have been studied. The goal of this study is to identify trans-acting sRNAs that can be substrates of RNase III. The endoribonuclease RNase III cleaves double stranded RNAs, which can be formed during the interaction between an sRNA and target mRNAs. RESULTS: For this study, we created an RNase III null mutant of Streptococcus pyogenes and its RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data were analyzed and compared to that of the wild-type. First, we developed a custom script that can detect intergenic regions of the S. pyogenes genome. A differential expression analysis with Cufflinks and Stringtie was then performed to identify the intergenic regions whose expression was influenced by the RNase III gene deletion. CONCLUSION: This analysis yielded 12 differentially expressed regions with >|2| fold change and p ≤ 0.05. Using Artemis and Bamview genome viewers, these regions were visually verified leaving 6 putative sRNAs. This study not only expanded our knowledge on novel sRNAs but would also give us new insight into sRNA degradation.},

    volume={10},
    ISSN={1553-734X},
    abstractNote={Noncoding RNAs are integral to a wide range of biological processes, including translation, gene regulation, host-pathogen interactions and environmental sensing. While genomics is now a mature field, our capacity to identify noncoding RNA elements in bacterial and archaeal genomes is hampered by the difficulty of de novo identification. The emergence of new technologies for characterizing transcriptome outputs, notably RNA-seq, are improving noncoding RNA identification and expression quantification. However, a major challenge is to robustly distinguish functional outputs from transcriptional noise. To establish whether annotation of existing transcriptome data has effectively captured all functional outputs, we analysed over 400 publicly available RNA-seq datasets spanning 37 different Archaea and Bacteria. Using comparative tools, we identify close to a thousand highly-expressed candidate noncoding RNAs. However, our analyses reveal that capacity to identify noncoding RNA outputs is strongly dependent on phylogenetic sampling. Surprisingly, and in stark contrast to protein-coding genes, the phylogenetic window for effective use of comparative methods is perversely narrow: aggregating public datasets only produced one phylogenetic cluster where these tools could be used to robustly separate unannotated noncoding RNAs from a null hypothesis of transcriptional noise. Our results show that for the full potential of transcriptomics data to be realized, a change in experimental design is paramount: effective transcriptomics requires phylogeny-aware sampling.},

    abstractNote={BACKGROUND: Structured noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) play essential roles in many biological processes such as gene regulation, signaling, RNA processing, and protein synthesis. Among the most common groups of ncRNAs in bacteria are riboswitches. These cis-regulatory, metabolite-binding RNAs are present in many species where they regulate various metabolic and signaling pathways. Collectively, there are likely to be hundreds of novel riboswitch classes that remain hidden in the bacterial genomes that have already been sequenced, and potentially thousands of classes distributed among various other species in the biosphere. The vast majority of these undiscovered classes are proposed to be exceedingly rare, and so current bioinformatics search techniques are reaching their limits for differentiating between true riboswitch candidates and false positives. RESULTS: Herein, we exploit a computational search pipeline that can efficiently identify intergenic regions most likely to encode structured ncRNAs. Application of this method to five bacterial genomes yielded nearly 70 novel genetic elements including 30 novel candidate ncRNA motifs. Among the riboswitch candidates identified is an RNA motif involved in the regulation of thiamin biosynthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of other genomes will undoubtedly lead to the discovery of many additional novel structured ncRNAs, and provide insight into the range of riboswitches and other kinds of ncRNAs remaining to be discovered in bacteria and archaea.},

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Bacterial small RNAs (sRNAs) are recognized as
              posttranscriptional regulators involved in the control of
              bacterial lifestyle and adaptation to stressful conditions.
              Although chemical stress due to the toxicity of precursor and
              product compounds is frequently encountered in microbial
              bioprocessing applications, the involvement of sRNAs in this
              process is not well understood. We have used RNA sequencing to
              map sRNA expression in E. coli under chemical stress and high
              cell density fermentation conditions with the aim of identifying
              sRNAs involved in the transcriptional response and those with
              potential roles in stress tolerance. RESULTS: RNA sequencing
              libraries were prepared from RNA isolated from E. coli K-12
              MG1655 cells grown under high cell density fermentation
              conditions or subjected to chemical stress with twelve compounds
              including four organic solvent-like compounds, four organic
              acids, two amino acids, geraniol and decanoic acid. We have
              discovered 253 novel intergenic transcripts with this approach,
              adding to the roughly 200 intergenic sRNAs previously reported in
              E. coli. There are eighty-four differentially expressed sRNAs
              during fermentation, of which the majority are novel, supporting
              possible regulatory roles for these transcripts in adaptation
              during different fermentation stages. There are a total of 139
              differentially expressed sRNAs under chemical stress conditions,
              where twenty-nine exhibit significant expression changes in
              multiple tested conditions, suggesting that they may be involved
              in a more general chemical stress response. Among those with
              known functions are sRNAs involved in regulation of outer
              membrane proteins, iron availability, maintaining envelope
              homeostasis, as well as sRNAs incorporated into complex networks
              controlling motility and biofilm formation. CONCLUSIONS: This
              study has used deep sequencing to reveal a wealth of hitherto
              undescribed sRNAs in E. coli and provides an atlas of sRNA
              expression during seventeen different growth and stress
              conditions. Although the number of novel sRNAs with regulatory
              functions is unknown, several exhibit specific expression
              patterns during high cell density fermentation and are
              differentially expressed in the presence of multiple chemicals,
              suggesting they may play regulatory roles during these stress
              conditions. These novel sRNAs, together with specific known
              sRNAs, are candidates for improving stress tolerance and our
              understanding of the E. coli regulatory network during fed-batch
              fermentation.",

We have performed a comparative analysis of PAO1 and PA14 strains which share the same host range but differ in virulence, PA14 being considerably more virulent in several model organisms. Altogether, we have identified more than 150 novel candidate sRNAs and validated a third of them by Northern blotting.

The human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa has an ability to thrive in a variety of hosts and cause a range of acute and chronic infections in individuals with impaired host defenses or cystic fibrosis. Here we report an in-depth transcriptional profiling of this organism when grown at host-related temperatures. Using RNA-seq of samples from P. aeruginosa grown at 28°C and 37°C we detected genes preferentially expressed at the body temperature of mammalian hosts, suggesting that they play a role during infection. These temperature-induced genes included the type III secretion system (T3SS) genes and effectors, as well as the genes responsible for phenazines biosynthesis. Using genome-wide transcription start site (TSS) mapping by RNA-seq we were able to accurately define the promoters and cis-acting RNA elements of many genes, and uncovered new genes and previously unrecognized non-coding RNAs directly controlled by the LasR quorum sensing regulator. Overall we identified 165 small RNAs and over 380 cis-antisense RNAs, some of which predicted to perform regulatory functions, and found that non-coding RNAs are preferentially localized in pathogenicity islands and horizontally transferred regions.

              species complex that includes a number of significant plant
              pathogens. Amongst these, P. syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa)
              initiated a worldwide pandemic in 2008 on cultivars of Actinidia
              chinensis var. chinensis. To gain information about the
              expression of genes involved in pathogenicity we have carried out
              transcriptome analysis of Psa during the early stages of
              kiwifruit infection. RESULTS: Gene expression in Psa was
              investigated during the first five days after infection of
              kiwifruit plantlets, using RNA-seq. Principal component and
              heatmap analyses showed distinct phases of gene expression during
              the time course of infection. The first phase was an immediate
              transient peak of induction around three hours post inoculation
              (HPI) that included genes that code for a Type VI Secretion
              System and nutrient acquisition (particularly phosphate). This
              was followed by a significant commitment, between 3 and 24 HPI,
              to the induction of genes encoding the Type III Secretion System
              (T3SS) and Type III Secreted Effectors (T3SE). Expression of
              these genes collectively accounted for 6.3\% of the bacterial
              transcriptome at this stage. There was considerable variation in
              the expression levels of individual T3SEs but all followed the
              same temporal expression pattern, with the exception of hopAS1,
              which peaked later in expression at 48 HPI. As infection
              progressed over the time course of five days, there was an
              increase in the expression of genes with roles in sugar, amino
              acid and sulfur transport and the production of alginate and
              colanic acid. These are both polymers that are major constituents
              of extracellular polysaccharide substances (EPS) and are involved
              in biofilm production. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR
              (RT-qPCR) on an independent infection time course experiment
              showed that the expression profile of selected bacterial genes at
              each infection phase correlated well with the RNA-seq data.
              CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study indicate that there is a
              complex remodeling of the transcriptome during the early stages

We have developed Trimmomatic as a more flexible and efficient preprocessing tool, which could correctly handle paired-end data. RESULTS: The value of NGS read preprocessing is demonstrated for both reference-based and reference-free tasks. Trimmomatic is shown to produce output that is at least competitive with, and in many cases superior to, that produced by other tools, in all scenarios tested.

We show that RNIE has superior performance in model species from a spectrum of bacterial phyla. Further analysis of species where a low number of RITs were predicted revealed a highly conserved structural sequence motif enriched near the genic termini of the pathogenic Actinobacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

    abstractNote={BACKGROUND: The prediction of a consensus structure for a set of related RNAs is an important first step for subsequent analyses. RNAalifold, which computes the minimum energy structure that is simultaneously formed by a set of aligned sequences, is one of the oldest and most widely used tools for this task. In recent years, several alternative approaches have been advocated, pointing to several shortcomings of the original RNAalifold approach. RESULTS: We show that the accuracy of RNAalifold predictions can be improved substantially by introducing a different, more rational handling of alignment gaps, and by replacing the rather simplistic model of covariance scoring with more sophisticated RIBOSUM-like scoring matrices. These improvements are achieved without compromising the computational efficiency of the algorithm. We show here that the new version of RNAalifold not only outperforms the old one, but also several other tools recently developed, on different datasets. CONCLUSION: The new version of RNAalifold not only can replace the old one for almost any application but it is also competitive with other approaches including those based on SCFGs, maximum expected accuracy, or hierarchical nearest neighbor classifiers.},

  abstract = "Facing the ever-growing list of newly discovered classes of
              functional RNAs, it can be expected that further types of
              functional RNAs are still hidden in recently completed genomes.
              The computational identification of such RNA genes is, therefore,
              of major importance. While most known functional RNAs have
              characteristic secondary structures, their free energies are
              generally not statistically significant enough to distinguish RNA
              genes from the genomic background. Additional information is
              required. Considering the wide availability of new genomic data
              of closely related species, comparative studies seem to be the
              most promising approach. Here, we show that prediction of
              consensus structures of aligned sequences can be a significant
              measure to detect functional RNAs. We report a new method to test
              multiple sequence alignments for the existence of an unusually

              system known as quorum sensing (QS). In its QS system, the psyI

              wild-type strain with those of the $\Delta$psyI mutant using RNA
              sequencing (RNA-seq) technology, 1118 AHL-regulated genes were
              identified in the transition from exponential to stationary

              pathogenicity were negatively controlled, including genes linked

              to select Abi proteins in the Pfam protein family database, we
              show that this family is larger than presently recognized. Using
              bacteriocin-associated Abi genes as a means to search for novel
              bacteriocins in sequenced genomes, seven new bacteriocin-like

               bacterial fitness, HGT underpins the evolution of pathogenicity
               and virulence in several bacterial pathogens. Pseudomonas
               syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa) first emerged as a pathogen of
               kiwifruit in Asia during the 1980's. In 2008 an outbreak
               occurred in Italy that rapidly spread to major kiwifruit growing
               areas of the world. During its global journey the outbreak
               lineage independently acquired divergent Integrative and
               Conjugative Elements (ICEs), harbouring an identical set of
               cargo genes that are hypothesized to be involved in the
               plant-­‐pathogen interaction. Here I show that the three ICEs
               acquired by Psa belong to a diverse family of ICEs present only
               in plant-­‐associated Pseudomonas ssp. (the PsICEs). The
               evolution of PsICEs is characterized by extensive inter-­‐ICE
               recombination events that are frequent enough to mask
               evolutionary history, producing chimeras with variable patterns
               of similarity to each other, yet maintaining a syntenic backbone
               where cargo genes are integrated in conserved positions.
               Although there are different classes of PsICE cargo genes, one
               set was frequently recovered: those contained on a Tn6212
               element. Tn6212 confers a selective benefit when Psa is grown on
               succinate, fumarate, or malate as the only carbon source, but no
               phenotype was detected in planta. Members of the PsICE family
               also confer copper resistance to Psa strains isolated in New
               Zealand. I analyzed a number of these and showed transfer in
               vitro and in planta. I also measured the fitness consequences of
               ICE carriage, captured the de novo formation of novel
               recombinant ICEs, and explored ICE host-­‐range. Together my

              bacteriophages, has remained enigmatic for almost two decades.
              Using comparative genomics, sequence-profile searches and

              transduction, RNA-dependent regulation, biosynthesis of

              suggests that the multiple metal-binding and non-binding TerD
              paralogs and TerC are likely to constitute a membrane-associated
              complex, which might also include TerB and TerY, and feature
              several, distinct metal-binding sites. Versions of the TerB
              domain might also bind small molecule ligands and link the TerD
              paralog-TerC complex to biosynthetic modules comprising
              phosphoribosyltransferases (PRTases), ATP grasp amidoligases,
              TIM-barrel carbon-carbon lyases, and HAD phosphoesterases, which

              of the PRTases is also likely to interact with RNA by means of
              its Pelota/Ribosomal protein L7AE-like domain. The von Willebrand
              factor A domain protein, TerY, is predicted to be part of a
              distinct phosphorylation switch, coupling a protein kinase and a
              PP2C phosphatase. We show, based on the evidence from numerous
              conserved gene neighborhoods and domain architectures, that both
              the TerB and TelA domains have been linked to diverse
              lipid-interaction domains, such as two novel PH-like and the Coq4
              domains, in different bacteria, and are likely to comprise
              membrane-associated sensory complexes that might additionally
              contain periplasmic binding-protein-II and OmpA domains. We also
              show that the TerD and TerB domains and the TerY-associated

              DNA-processing complexes, which feature proteins with SWI2/SNF2

              transcript and a 1.4-kb truncated transcript lacking 3' ureB.
              Acidic pH (pH 4.5) results in a significant increase in

              Flagellar expression is environmentally controlled, presumably to
              optimize the benefits and liabilities of having these organelles
              on cell growth and survival. We recently reported a global survey
              of AlgU-dependent regulation and binding in Pseudomonas syringae
              pv. tomato DC3000 that included evidence for strong
              downregulation of many flagellar and chemotaxis motility genes.
              Here, we returned to those data to look for other AlgU-dependent
              influences on the flagellar regulatory network. We identified an

              syringae pv tomato DC3000 with the finished, complete genomes of
              Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, an animal pathogen, and the
              non-pathogenic soil inhabitant Pseudomonas putida KT2440 revealed
              a high degree of sequence conservation in genes involved in
              'housekeeping functions'. However, divergence is present among
              these three fluorescent pseudomonads, yielding 'suites' of
              species-specific genes that may provide the genetic basis for
              adaptation to an ecological niche and lifestyle. For DC3000, 1053
              genes located on the chromosome were specific to DC3000 and not
              present in PAO1 or KT2440. The majority of these DC3000-specific
              genes either lack a known function or are mobile genetic
              elements. However, these genes do share features among themselves
              such as association with regions of atypical trinucleotides,
              unusual G+C content and localization within large tracts of
              DC3000-specific sequence, suggestive of lateral gene transfer
              events. Indeed, a comparison of syntenic blocks among these three
              complete Pseudomonas genomes revealed that a substantial portion
              (533) of the DC3000-specific chromosomal genes (1053) were
              located in lineage-specific regions (defined as being larger than
              2 kb and enriched in mobile genetic elements and/or genes
              specific to DC3000 in this three-way comparison). A large
              proportion of mobile genetic elements (199 of 318 genes; 63\%),
              which are highly enriched in DC3000, were present within such
              regions. Similarly, most of the genes encoding type III secretion
              system virulence effectors were located in lineage-specific
              regions. Consistent with the plasticity of the DC3000 genome, a
              putative chromosomal inversion mediated by identical copies of
              ISPsy6 involving 2838 kb (44\%) of the DC3000 genome was
              detected. These data suggest that a substantial portion of the
              differentiation of DC3000, a plant pathogen, from an animal
              pathogen and a soil inhabitant has involved transfer of a large

              levels, whereas the post-transcriptional regulation of rpoS in P.
              aeruginosa remains unclear. To identify and characterize small
              regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) regulating RpoS in P. aeruginosa, an sRNA

              examine their regulatory roles on rpoS expression. Our results

              Unlike OxyS, an sRNA previously known to repress rpoS expression

              have diverse regulatory roles. Most of these sRNAs have been
              discovered by a combination of computational and experimental
              methods. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a ubiquitous Gram-negative
              bacterium and opportunistic human pathogen, the GacS/GacA
              two-component system positively controls the transcription of two
              sRNAs (RsmY, RsmZ), which are crucial for the expression of genes
              involved in virulence. In the biocontrol bacterium Pseudomonas
              fluorescens CHA0, three GacA-controlled sRNAs (RsmX, RsmY, RsmZ)
              regulate the response to oxidative stress and the expression of
              extracellular products including biocontrol factors. RsmX, RsmY
              and RsmZ contain multiple unpaired GGA motifs and control the
              expression of target mRNAs at the translational level, by
              sequestration of translational repressor proteins of the RsmA
              family. RESULTS: A combined computational and experimental
              approach enabled us to identify 14 intergenic regions encoding
              sRNAs in P. aeruginosa. Eight of these regions encode newly
              identified sRNAs. The intergenic region 1698 was found to specify
              a novel GacA-controlled sRNA termed RgsA. GacA regulation
              appeared to be indirect. In P. fluorescens CHA0, an RgsA homolog
              was also expressed under positive GacA control. This 120-nt sRNA
              contained a single GGA motif and, unlike RsmX, RsmY and RsmZ, was
              unable to derepress translation of the hcnA gene (involved in the
              biosynthesis of the biocontrol factor hydrogen cyanide), but
              contributed to the bacterium's resistance to hydrogen peroxide.
              In both P. aeruginosa and P. fluorescens the stress sigma factor
              RpoS was essential for RgsA expression. CONCLUSION: The discovery
              of an additional sRNA expressed under GacA control in two
              Pseudomonas species highlights the complexity of this global
              regulatory system and suggests that the mode of action of GacA
              control may be more elaborate than previously suspected. Our
              results also confirm that several GGA motifs are required in an
              sRNA for sequestration of the RsmA protein.",

              genomics, in which homologous sequences are identified and

              RESULTS: By applying a comparative genomics-based approach to
              genome and metagenome sequences from bacteria and archaea, we
              identified 104 candidate structured RNAs and inferred putative
              functions for many of these. Twelve candidate metabolite-binding
              RNAs were identified, three of which were validated, including
              one reported herein that binds the coenzyme S-adenosylmethionine.
              Newly identified cis-regulatory RNAs are implicated in

              biochemical and genetic studies needed to validate their biologic
              functions. Given the sustained rate of RNA discovery over several

              to be discovered from bacterial and archaeal organisms.",

              a prelude to analysis of the regulatory genes and their targets,
              we have focused on GacA, the response regulator of a
              two-component system. The DC3000 gene was cloned by testing for
              the reversal of phenotypes of an Erwinia GacA- mutant. A GacA-
              mutant of DC3000 constructed by marker exchange produces
              much-reduced levels of transcripts of three alternate sigma
              factors: HrpL, required for the production of effector proteins
              and their translocation via the type III secretion system; RpoS,
              required for stress responses and secondary metabolite
              production; and RpoN, required for an assortment of metabolic
              processes and expression of hrpL. GacA deficiency also reduces
              the expression of hrpR and hrpS, which specify enhancer-binding
              proteins of the NtrC family required for hrpL transcription; ahlI
              and ahlR, the genes for quorum sensing signal; salA, a regulatory
              gene known to control virulence; CorS, a sensor kinase; CorR, the
              cognate response regulator that controls coronatine biosynthetic
              genes; and rsmB and rsmZ, which specify untranslatable regulatory
              RNA species. gacA expression itself is regulated by environmental
              conditions in DC3000, since transcript levels are affected by
              growth phase and media composition. The observations that high
              levels of gacA RNA occur in the hrp-inducing medium and GacA
              deficiency reduces the levels of rpoS expression implicate an
              important role of GacA in stress responses of DC3000. Consistent
              with the effects on hrpL expression, the GacA- mutant produces
              lower levels of transcripts of avr, hrp, and hop genes controlled
              by HrpL. In addition, GacA deficiency results in reduced levels
              of transcripts of several HrpL-independent genes. As would be
              expected, these effects on gene expression cause drastic changes

              signal; and swarming motility. Our findings establish that GacA,
              located at the top in a regulatory cascade in DC3000, functions

              identified seventeen types of insertion sequences and two
              miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) with a
              biased distribution, representing 2.8\% of the chromosome, 25.8\%
              of the 132-kb virulence plasmid and 2.7\% of the 52-kb plasmid.
              Employing an entrapment vector containing sacB, we estimated that
              transposition frequency oscillated between 2.6$\times$10(-5) and
              1.1$\times$10(-6), depending on the clone, although it was stable
              for each clone after consecutive transfers in culture media.
              Transposition frequency was similar for bacteria grown in rich or
              minimal media, and from cells recovered from compatible and
              incompatible plant hosts, indicating that growth conditions do
              not influence transposition in strain 1448A. Most of the
              entrapped insertions contained a full-length IS801 element, with
              the remaining insertions corresponding to sequences smaller than
              any transposable element identified in strain 1448A, and
              collectively identified as miniature sequences. From these,
              fragments of 229, 360 and 679-nt of the right end of IS801 ended
              in a consensus tetranucleotide and likely resulted from one-ended
              transposition of IS801. An average 0.7\% of the insertions
              analyzed consisted of IS801 carrying a fragment of variable size
              from gene PSPPH\_0008/PSPPH\_0017, showing that IS801 can
              mobilize DNA in vivo. Retrospective analysis of complete plasmids
              and genomes of P. syringae suggests, however, that most fragments
              of IS801 are likely the result of reorganizations rather than
              one-ended transpositions, and that this element might
              preferentially contribute to genome flexibility by generating
              homologous regions of recombination. A further miniature sequence
              previously found to affect host range specificity and virulence,
              designated MITEPsy1 (100-nt), represented an average 2.4\% of the

              indigenous to the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae and these
              plasmids are widely distributed and widely transferred among
              pathovars of P. syringae and related species. pPT23A-family
              plasmids (PFPs) are sources of accessory genes for their hosts
              that can include genes important for virulence and epiphytic
              colonization of plant leaf surfaces. The occurrence of repeated
              sequences including duplicated insertion sequences on PFPs has
              made obtaining closed plasmid genome sequences difficult.
              Therefore, our objective was to obtain complete genome sequences
              from PFPs from divergent P. syringae pathovars and also from
              strains of P. syringae pv. syringae isolated from different
              hosts. RESULTS: The eight plasmids sequenced ranged in length
              from 61.6 to 73.8 kb and encoded from 65 to 83 annotated orfs.
              Virulence genes including type III secretion system effectors
              were encoded on two plasmids, and one of these, pPt0893-29 from
              P. syringae pv. tabaci, encoded a wide variety of putative
              virulence determinants. The PFPs from P. syringae pv. syringae
              mostly encoded genes of importance to ecological fitness
              including the rulAB determinant conferring tolerance to
              ultraviolet radiation. Heavy metal resistance genes encoding
              resistance to copper and arsenic were also present in a few
              plasmids. The discovery of part of the chromosomal genomic island
              GI6 from P. syringae pv. syringae B728a in two PFPs from two P.
              syringae pv. syringae hosts is further evidence of past
              intergenetic transfers between plasmid and chromosomal DNA.
              Phylogenetic analyses also revealed new subgroups of the pPT23A
              plasmid family and confirmed that plasmid phylogeny is
              incongruent with P. syringae pathovar or host of isolation. In
              addition, conserved genes among seven sequenced plasmids within
              the same phylogenetic group were limited to plasmid-specific
              functions including maintenance and transfer functions.
              CONCLUSIONS: Our sequence analysis further revealed that PFPs
              from P. syringae encode suites of accessory genes that are
              selected at species (universal distribution), pathovar
              (interpathovar distribution), and population levels
              (intrapathovar distribution). The conservation of type IV
              secretion systems encoding conjugation functions also presumably
              contributes to the distribution of these plasmids within P.

  abstract  = "Nearly two decades after Westhof and Michel first proposed that
               RNA tetraloops may interact with distal helices,
               tetraloop--receptor interactions have been recognized as
               ubiquitous elements of RNA tertiary structure. The unique
               architecture of GNRA tetraloops (N=any nucleotide, R=purine)
               enables interaction with a variety of receptors, e.g., helical
               minor grooves and asymmetric internal loops. The most common
               example of the latter is the GAAA tetraloop--11 nt tetraloop
               receptor motif. Biophysical characterization of this motif
               provided evidence for the modularity of RNA structure, with
               applications spanning improved crystallization methods to RNA

              with distinct acute and chronic virulence phenotypes. Whereas
              acute virulence is typically associated with expression of a type
              III secretion system (T3SS), chronic virulence is characterized
              by biofilm formation. Many of the phenotypes associated with
              acute and chronic virulence are inversely regulated by RsmA and
              RsmF. RsmA and RsmF are both members of the CsrA family of
              RNA-binding proteins and regulate protein synthesis at the
              posttranscriptional level. RsmA activity is controlled by two
              small noncoding regulatory RNAs (RsmY and RsmZ). Bioinformatic
              analyses suggest that RsmY and RsmZ each have 3 or 4 putative
              RsmA binding sites. Each predicted binding site contains a GGA
              sequence presented in the loop portion of a stem-loop structure.
              RsmY and RsmZ regulate RsmA, and possibly RsmF, by sequestering
              these proteins from target mRNAs. In this study, we used
              selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension and
              mutational profiling (SHAPE-MaP) chemistry to determine the
              secondary structures of RsmY and RsmZ and functional assays to
              characterize the contribution of each GGA site to RsmY/RsmZ
              activity. Our data indicate that RsmA has two preferential
              binding sites on RsmY and RsmZ, while RsmF has one preferential
              binding site on RsmY and two sites on RsmZ. Despite RsmF and RsmA
              sharing a common consensus site, RsmF binding properties are more
              restrictive than those of RsmA.IMPORTANCE CsrA homologs are
              present in many bacteria. The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas
              aeruginosa uses RsmA and RsmF to inversely regulate factors
              associated with acute and chronic virulence phenotypes. RsmA has
              an affinity for RsmY and RsmZ higher than that of RsmF. The goal
              of this study was to understand the differential binding
              properties of RsmA and RsmF by using the RsmY and RsmZ regulatory
              small RNAs (sRNAs) as a model. Mutagenesis of the predicted
              RsmA/RsmF binding sites on RsmY and RsmZ revealed similarities in
              the sites required to control RsmA and RsmF activity in vivo
              Whereas binding by RsmA was relatively tolerant of binding site
              mutations, RsmF was sensitive to disruption to all but two of the
              sites, further demonstrating that the requirements for RsmF

              noncoding RNAs, there is an increasing need to create schematic
              diagrams showing the consensus features of these molecules. RNA
              structural diagrams are typically made either with
              general-purpose drawing programs like Adobe Illustrator, or with
              automated or interactive programs specific to RNA. Unfortunately,
              the use of applications like Illustrator is extremely time
              consuming, while existing RNA-specific programs produce figures
              that are useful, but usually not of the same aesthetic quality as
              those produced at great cost in Illustrator. Additionally, most
              existing RNA-specific applications are designed for drawing
              single RNA molecules, not consensus diagrams. RESULTS: We created
              R2R, a computer program that facilitates the generation of
              aesthetic and readable drawings of RNA consensus diagrams in a
              fraction of the time required with general-purpose drawing
              programs. Since the inference of a consensus RNA structure
              typically requires a multiple-sequence alignment, the R2R user
              annotates the alignment with commands directing the layout and
              annotation of the RNA. R2R creates SVG or PDF output that can be
              imported into Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape or CorelDRAW. R2R can
              be used to create consensus sequence and secondary structure
              models for novel RNA structures or to revise models when new
              representatives for known RNA classes become available. Although
              R2R does not currently have a graphical user interface, it has
              proven useful in our efforts to create 100 schematic models of
              distinct noncoding RNA classes. CONCLUSIONS: R2R makes it
              possible to obtain high-quality drawings of the consensus

              short-chain esters, 17 demonstrated arylesterase activity, while
              38 proteins did not exhibit any activity towards the test
              substrates. Esterases from Rhodopseudomonas palustris (RpEST-1,
              RpEST-2 and RpEST-3), Pseudomonas putida (PpEST-1, PpEST-2 and
              PpEST-3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PaEST-1) and Streptomyces
              avermitilis (SavEST-1) were selected for detailed biochemical
              characterization. All of the enzymes showed optimal activity at
              neutral or alkaline pH, and the half-life of each enzyme at 50°C
              ranged from < 5 min to over 5 h. PpEST-3, RpEST-1 and RpEST-2
              demonstrated the highest specific activity with pNP-esters; these
              enzymes were also among the most stable at 50°C and in the
              presence of detergents, polar and non-polar organic solvents, and
              imidazolium ionic liquids. Accordingly, these enzymes are
              particularly interesting targets for subsequent application
              trials. Finally, biochemical and bioinformatic analyses were
              compared to reveal sequence features that could be correlated to
              enzymes with arylesterase activity, facilitating subsequent
              searches for new esterases in microbial genome sequences.",

              small RNA is located between the coding regions of the rpsO and
              pnp genes, and it is transcribed in the opposite direction
              relative to the two genes. No function has been assigned to SraG.
              Multiple levels of post-transcriptional regulation have been
              demonstrated for the rpsO-pnp operon. Here we show that SraG is a
              new factor affecting pnp expression. SraG overexpression results
              in a reduction of pnp expression and a destabilization of pnp
              mRNA; in contrast, inhibition of SraG transcription results in a
              higher level of the pnp transcript. Furthermore, in vitro
              experiments indicate that SraG inhibits translation initiation of
              pnp Together, these observations demonstrate that SraG
              participates in the post-transcriptional control of pnp by a
              direct antisense interaction between SraG and PNPase RNAs. Our

  abstract = "Profile hidden Markov models (profile HMMs) and probabilistic
              inference methods have made important contributions to the theory
              of sequence database homology search. However, practical use of
              profile HMM methods has been hindered by the computational
              expense of existing software implementations. Here I describe an
              acceleration heuristic for profile HMMs, the ``multiple segment
              Viterbi'' (MSV) algorithm. The MSV algorithm computes an optimal
              sum of multiple ungapped local alignment segments using a striped
              vector-parallel approach previously described for fast
              Smith/Waterman alignment. MSV scores follow the same statistical
              distribution as gapped optimal local alignment scores, allowing
              rapid evaluation of significance of an MSV score and thus
              facilitating its use as a heuristic filter. I also describe a
              20-fold acceleration of the standard profile HMM Forward/Backward
              algorithms using a method I call ``sparse rescaling''. These
              methods are assembled in a pipeline in which high-scoring MSV
              hits are passed on for reanalysis with the full HMM
              Forward/Backward algorithm. This accelerated pipeline is
              implemented in the freely available HMMER3 software package.
              Performance benchmarks show that the use of the heuristic MSV
              filter sacrifices negligible sensitivity compared to
              unaccelerated profile HMM searches. HMMER3 is substantially more
              sensitive and 100- to 1000-fold faster than HMMER2. HMMER3 is now
              about as fast as BLAST for protein searches.",
