  abstract = "A critical assumption of gene expression analysis is that mRNA
              abundances broadly correlate with protein abundance, but these
              two are often imperfectly correlated. Some of the discrepancy can
              be accounted for by two important mRNA features: codon usage and
              mRNA secondary structure. We present a new global factor, called
              mRNA:ncRNA avoidance, and provide evidence that avoidance
              increases translational efficiency. We also demonstrate a strong
              selection for the avoidance of stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions
              across prokaryotes, and that these have a greater impact on
              protein abundance than mRNA structure or codon usage. By
              generating synonymously variant green fluorescent protein (GFP)
              mRNAs with different potential for mRNA:ncRNA interactions, we
              demonstrate that GFP levels correlate well with interaction
              avoidance. Therefore, taking stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions
              into account enables precise modulation of protein abundance.",

              UPEC differ from non-pathogenic E. coli and from other E. coli

              toxins, 'modulins', capsules, iron uptake systems and other
              bacterial products contribute to the virulence of the strains.
              The respective genes are frequently located on large pieces of
              DNA called 'pathogenicity islands' (PAIs). PAIs form (unstable)

  author   = "Rastogi, Shruti and Liberles, David A",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Gene duplication has been suggested to be an
              important process in the generation of evolutionary novelty.
              Neofunctionalization, as an adaptive process where one copy
              mutates into a function that was not present in the
              pre-duplication gene, is one mechanism that can lead to the
              retention of both copies. More recently, subfunctionalization, as
              a neutral process where the two copies partition the ancestral
              function, has been proposed as an alternative mechanism driving
              duplicate gene retention in organisms with small effective
              population sizes. The relative importance of these two processes
              is unclear. RESULTS: A set of lattice model genes that fold and
              bind to two peptide ligands with overlapping binding pockets, but
              not a third ligand present in the cell was designed. Each gene
              was duplicated in a model haploid species with a small constant
              population size and no recombination. One set of models allowed
              subfunctionalization of binding events following duplication,
              while another set did not allow subfunctionalization. Modeling
              under such conditions suggests that subfunctionalization plays an
              important role, but as a transition state to neofunctionalization
              rather than as a terminal fate of duplicated genes. There is no
              apparent selective pressure to maintain redundancy. CONCLUSION:
              Subfunctionalization results in an increase in the preservation
              of duplicated gene copies, including those that are
              neofunctionalized, but never represents a substantial fraction of
              duplicate gene copies at any evolutionary time point and
              ultimately leads to neofunctionalization of those preserved
              copies. This conclusion also may reflect changes in gene function
              after duplication with time in real genomes.",

  abstract = "Mutation is the engine that drives evolution and adaptation
              forward in that it generates the variation on which natural
              selection acts. Mutation is a random process that nevertheless
              occurs according to certain biases. Elucidating mutational biases
              and the way they vary across species and within genomes is
              crucial to understanding evolution and adaptation. Here we
              demonstrate that clonal pathogens that evolve under severely
              relaxed selection are uniquely suitable for studying mutational
              biases in bacteria. We estimate mutational patterns using
              sequence datasets from five such clonal pathogens belonging to
              four diverse bacterial clades that span most of the range of
              genomic nucleotide content. We demonstrate that across different
              types of sites and in all four clades mutation is consistently
              biased towards AT. This is true even in clades that have high
              genomic GC content. In all studied cases the mutational bias
              towards AT is primarily due to the high rate of C/G to T/A

              biases are far less variable than previously thought. They
              further demonstrate that variation in nucleotide content cannot
              stem entirely from variation in mutational biases and that
              natural selection and/or a natural selection-like process such as

              RNA-seq was implemented to investigate the noncoding

              24-bisnorchola-1,4-dien-3-one (1,4-BNA). RESULTS: A total of 263
              sRNA candidates were predicted from the intergenic regions in Mn.
              Differential expression of sRNA candidates was explored in the
              wide type Mn with vs without sterol addition, and the steroid
              intermediate producing Mn strains vs wide type Mn with sterol
              addition, respectively. Generally, sRNA candidates were
              differentially expressed in various strains, but there were still
              some shared candidates with outstandingly upregulated or
              downregulated expression in these steroid producing strains.
              Accordingly, four regulatory networks were constructed to reveal
              the direct and/or indirect interactions between sRNA candidates
              and their target genes in four groups, including wide type Mn
              with vs without sterol addition, 9OHAD, ADD, and BNA producing
              strains vs wide type Mn with sterol addition, respectively. Based
              on these constructed networks, several highly focused sRNA
              candidates were discovered to be prevalent in the networks, which
              showed comprehensive regulatory roles in various cellular
              processes, including lipid transport and metabolism, amino acid
              transport and metabolism, signal transduction, cell envelope
              biosynthesis and ATP synthesis. To explore the functional role of
              sRNA candidates in Mn cells, we manipulated the overexpression of
              candidates 131 and 138 in strain Mn-9OHAD, which led to enhanced
              production of 9OHAD from 1.5- to 2.3-fold during 6 d'

              noncoding small RNAs in the metabolism of sterols to produce
              steroid intermediates in Mn, further analysis of which will

              provide the first direct evidence that a pathogenicity
              island-encoded sRNA, IsrM, is important for Salmonella invasion
              of epithelial cells, intracellular replication inside
              macrophages, and virulence and colonization in mice. IsrM RNA is
              expressed in vitro under conditions resembling those during

              found to be differentially expressed in vivo, with higher
              expression in the ileum than in the spleen. IsrM targets the
              mRNAs coding for SopA, a SPI-1 effector, and HilE, a global
              regulator of the expression of SPI-1 proteins, which are major

              Contrary to expectations, we find that random sequences with

              formation of alternative structures that, in the repressing

              inhibition of translation initiation. Riboswitches regulate
              several metabolic pathways including the biosynthesis of vitamins

              methionine, lysine and purines. Candidate riboswitches have also

              of genomes containing riboswitches and the diversity of molecular
              mechanisms of regulation, in addition to the fact that direct
              interaction of riboswitches with their effectors does not require

              sRNAs were also detected directly from purification and RNA
              sequence determination. In total, at least 12 sRNAs are expressed

               RyhB RNA levels are inversely correlated with mRNA levels for
               the sdhCDAB operon, encoding succinate dehydrogenase, as well as
               five other genes previously shown to be positively regulated by

              size in eukaryotes, especially in multicellular species. One idea
              is that all excess DNA is mutationally hazardous, but weakly
              enough so that genome-size expansion passively emerges in species
              experiencing relatively low efficiency of selection owing to
              small effective population sizes. Another idea is that
              substantial gene additions were impossible without the energetic
              boost provided by the colonizing mitochondrion in the eukaryotic
              lineage. Contrary to this latter view, analysis of cellular
              energetics and genomics data from a wide variety of species

              Thus, for scaling reasons that are not yet understood, by virtue

              important functions, and therefore GC content and its
              distribution are routinely reported for sequenced genomes.
              Traditionally, GC content distribution is assessed by computing
              GC contents in windows that slide along the genome. Disadvantages
              of this routinely used window-based method include low resolution

              displaying GC content variations across the genome. Compared to
              the window-based method, the GC profile has the following
              advantages: 1) higher sensitivity, because of
              variation-amplifying procedures; 2) higher resolution, because
              boundaries between domains can be determined at one single base

              are obtained for arbitrary mutation rates and standing variance.
              For nonepistatic mutations, especially with beneficial mutations,
              this approximation fails over the long term but captures the
              early dynamics, thus complementing stationary stochastic
              predictions. The approximation also handles several diminishing
              returns epistasis models (e.g., with an optimal genotype); it can
              be applied at and away from equilibrium. General results arise at
              equilibrium, where fitness distributions display a ``phase
              transition'' with mutation rate. Beyond this phase transition, in
              Fisher's geometric model, the full trajectory of fitness and
              trait distributions takes a simple form; robust to the details of
              the mutant phenotype distribution. Analytical arguments are
              explored regarding why and when the deterministic approximation

               become evident that sRNAs play central regulatory roles in the
               cell, little is known about their evolution and the evolution of
               their regulatory interactions. Here we used the prokaryotic
               phylogenetic tree to reconstruct the evolutionary history of
               Escherichia coli sRNAs and their binding sites on target mRNAs.
               We discovered that sRNAs currently present in E. coli mainly
               accumulated inside the Enterobacteriales order, succeeding the
               appearance of other types of noncoding RNAs and concurrently
               with the evolution of a variant of the Hfq protein exhibiting a
               longer C-terminal region. Our analysis of the evolutionary ages
               of sRNA-mRNA interactions revealed that while all sRNAs were
               evolutionarily older than most of their known binding sites on
               mRNA targets, for quite a few sRNAs there was at least one
               binding site that coappeared with or preceded them. It is
               conceivable that the establishment of these first interactions
               forced selective pressure on the sRNAs, after which additional
               targets were acquired by fitting a binding site to the active
               region of the sRNA. This conjecture is supported by the
               appearance of many binding sites on target mRNAs only after the
               sRNA gain, despite the prior presence of the target gene in
               ancestral genomes. Our results suggest a selective mechanism
               that maintained the sRNAs across the phylogenetic tree, and shed

              pursuit unifying the life sciences. Bacteria represent an
              especially striking puzzle, because closely related strains
              possess radically different metabolic and ecological
              capabilities. Differences in protein repertoire arising from gene
              transfer are currently considered the primary mechanism
              underlying phenotypic plasticity in bacteria. Although bacterial
              coding plasticity has been extensively studied in previous
              decades, little is known about the role that regulatory
              plasticity plays in bacterial evolution. Here, we show that
              bacterial genes can rapidly shift between multiple regulatory
              modes by acquiring functionally divergent nonhomologous promoter
              regions. Through analysis of 270,000 regulatory regions across
              247 genomes, we demonstrate that regulatory ``switching'' to
              nonhomologous alternatives is ubiquitous, occurring across the
              bacterial domain. Using comparative transcriptomics, we show that
              at least 16\% of the expression divergence between Escherichia
              coli strains can be explained by this regulatory switching.
              Further, using an oligonucleotide regulatory library, we
              establish that switching affects bacterial promoter architecture.
              We provide evidence that regulatory switching can occur through
              horizontal regulatory transfer, which allows regulatory regions
              to move across strains, and even genera, independently from the
              genes they regulate. Finally, by experimentally characterizing
              the fitness effect of a regulatory transfer on a pathogenic E.
              coli strain, we demonstrate that regulatory switching elicits
              important phenotypic consequences. Taken together, our findings

              regulatory molecules and have been studied in several bacteria.
              However, to date, there have been no whole-transcriptome studies
              on sRNAs in any of the Soft Rot Enterobacteriaceae (SRE) group of
              pathogens. Although the main ecological niches for these
              pathogens are plants, a significant part of their life cycle is
              undertaken outside their host within adverse soil environment.
              However, the mechanisms of SRE adaptation to this harsh
              nutrient-deficient environment are poorly understood. RESULTS: In
              the study reported herein, by using strand-specific RNA-seq
              analysis and in silico sRNA predictions, we describe the sRNA
              pool of Pectobacterium atrosepticum and reveal numerous sRNA
              candidates, including those that are induced during
              starvation-activated stress responses. Consequently,
              strand-specific RNA-seq enabled detection of 137 sRNAs and sRNA
              candidates under starvation conditions; 25 of these sRNAs were
              predicted for this bacterium in silico. Functional annotations
              were computationally assigned to 68 sRNAs. The expression of
              sRNAs in P. atrosepticum was compared under growth-promoting and
              starvation conditions: 68 sRNAs were differentially expressed
              with 47 sRNAs up-regulated under nutrient-deficient conditions.
              Conservation analysis using BLAST showed that most of the
              identified sRNAs are conserved within the SRE. Subsequently, we
              identified 9 novel sRNAs within the P. atrosepticum genome.
              CONCLUSIONS: Since many of the identified sRNAs are
              starvation-induced, the results of our study suggests that sRNAs
              play key roles in bacterial adaptive response. Finally, this work

              Hfq, which can regulate sRNA-mRNA basepairing, plays a critical
              role in rRNA processing and ribosome assembly in Escherichia coli
              Hfq binds the 17S rRNA precursor and facilitates its correct
              processing and folding to mature 16S rRNA Hfq assists ribosome
              assembly and associates with pre-30S particles but not with
              mature 30S subunits. Inactivation of Hfq strikingly decreases the
              pool of mature 70S ribosomes. The reduction in ribosome levels
              depends on residues located in the distal face of Hfq but not on
              residues found in the proximal and rim surfaces which govern
              interactions with the sRNAs. Our results indicate that
              Hfq-mediated regulation of ribosomes is independent of its

              inactivation of Hfq compromises translation efficiency and

              repeats occurring in complete genomes of bacteria. Inverted
              repeats are compatible with the formation of hairpin structures
              in the messenger RNA. Some of these structures are known to be
              rho-independent intrinsic terminators. RESULTS: We investigate
              the number of inverted repeats observed in 37 complete genomes of
              bacteria. The number of inverted repeats observed is much higher
              than expected using Markovian models of DNA sequences in most of
              the eubacteria. By using the information annotated in the genomes
              we discover that in most of the eubacteria the inverted repeats
              of stem length longer than 8 nucleotides preferentially locate
              near the 3' end of the nearest coding regions. We also show that
              IRs characterized by large values of the stem length locate
              preferentially in short non-coding regions bounded by two 3' ends
              of convergent genes. By using the program TransTerm recently
              introduced to predict transcription terminators in bacterial

               because of the regulatory roles of sRNAs, differences in sRNA

  author    = "Raghavan, Rahul and Sloan, Daniel B and Ochman, Howard",
  abstract  = "Noncoding RNAs, including antisense RNAs (asRNAs) that originate
               from the complementary strand of protein-coding genes, are
               involved in the regulation of gene expression in all domains of
               life. Recent application of deep-sequencing technologies has
               revealed that the transcription of asRNAs occurs genome-wide in
               bacteria. Although the role of the vast majority of asRNAs
               remains unknown, it is often assumed that their presence implies
               important regulatory functions, similar to those of other
               noncoding RNAs. Alternatively, many antisense transcripts may be
               produced by chance transcription events from promoter-like
               sequences that result from the degenerate nature of bacterial
               transcription factor binding sites. To investigate the
               biological relevance of antisense transcripts, we compared
               genome-wide patterns of asRNA expression in closely related
               enteric bacteria, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica
               serovar Typhimurium, by performing strand-specific transcriptome
               sequencing. Although antisense transcripts are abundant in both
               species, less than 3\% of asRNAs are expressed at high levels in
               both species, and only about 14\% appear to be conserved among
               species. And unlike the promoters of protein-coding genes, asRNA
               promoters show no evidence of sequence conservation between, or
               even within, species. Our findings suggest that many or even
               most bacterial asRNAs are nonadaptive by-products of the cell's
               transcription machinery. IMPORTANCE Application of
               high-throughput methods has revealed the expression throughout
               bacterial genomes of transcripts encoded on the strand
               complementary to protein-coding genes. Because transcription is
               costly, it is usually assumed that these transcripts, termed
               antisense RNAs (asRNAs), serve some function; however, the role
               of most asRNAs is unclear, raising questions about their
               relevance in cellular processes. Because natural selection
               conserves functional elements, comparisons between related
               species provide a method for assessing functionality
               genome-wide. Applying such an approach, we assayed all
               transcripts in two closely related bacteria, Escherichia coli
               and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and demonstrate
               that, although the levels of genome-wide antisense transcription
               are similarly high in both bacteria, only a small fraction of
               asRNAs are shared across species. Moreover, the promoters
               associated with asRNAs show no evidence of sequence conservation
               between, or even within, species. These findings indicate that
               despite the genome-wide transcription of asRNAs, many of these
               transcripts are likely nonfunctional.",

              profiling of all transcripts in a cell. However, primary sequence
              per se is a poor predictor of function, as ncRNAs dramatically

               For this purpose, we compiled a set of 71 experimentally

               transcription start sites. Only interaction sites in sRNAs, but
               not in targets, show significant sequence conservation. In
               addition to this observation, we found that the base pairing
               between sRNAs and their targets is not conserved in general
               across more distantly related species. A closer inspection of
               RybB and RyhB sRNAs and their targets revealed that the base

               However, some genes, including those involved in iron storage,
               are positively regulated by Fur. A Fur-repressed regulatory
               small RNA (sRNA), RyhB, has been identified in Escherichia coli,
               and it has been demonstrated that negative regulation of genes
               by this sRNA is responsible for the positive regulation of some
               genes by Fur. No RyhB sequence homologs were found in
               Pseudomonas aeruginosa, despite the identification of genes
               positively regulated by its Fur homolog. A bioinformatics
               approach identified two tandem sRNAs in P. aeruginosa that were
               candidates for functional homologs of RyhB. These sRNAs (PrrF1
               and PrrF2) are >95\% identical to each other, and a functional
               Fur box precedes each. Their expression is induced under iron
               limitation. Deletion of both sRNAs is required to affect the
               iron-dependent regulation of an array of genes, including those
               involved in resistance to oxidative stress, iron storage, and
               intermediary metabolism. As in E. coli, induction of the PrrF
               sRNAs leads to the rapid loss of mRNAs for sodB (superoxide
               dismutase), sdh (succinate dehydrogenase), and a gene encoding a

               regulated by Fur and Fe(2+), even in the absence of the PrrF
               sRNAs. This work suggests that the role of sRNAs in bacterial
               iron homeostasis may be broad, and approaches similar to those

              Inspired by new data from 28 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas

               infection, but basic genetic information such as the global
               locations of transcription start sites (TSSs) has been lacking.
               We combined three RNA-sequencing techniques and two sequencing

               Typhimurium. Differential RNA sequencing identified 1,873 TSSs
               on the chromosome of S. Typhimurium SL1344 and 13\% of these
               TSSs initiated antisense transcripts. Unique findings include
               the TSSs of the virulence regulators phoP, slyA, and invF.
               Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that RNA polymerase was
               bound to 70\% of the TSSs, and two-thirds of these TSSs were

              the analyzed strains. These global TSS maps are refined through
              the integration of a SuperGenome approach that allows for a
              comparative TSS annotation by mapping RNA-seq data of multiple
              strains into a common coordinate system derived from a
              whole-genome alignment. Considering the steadily increasing
              amount of RNA-seq studies, our automated TSS annotation will not
              only facilitate transcriptome annotation for a wider range of
              pro- and eukaryotes but can also be adapted for the analysis
              among different growth or stress conditions. Our comparative
              dRNA-seq analysis revealed conservation of most TSS, but also
              single-nucleotide-polymorphisms (SNP) in promoter regions, which
              lead to strain-specific transcriptional output. Furthermore, we
              identified strain-specific sRNA repertoires that could contribute
              to differential gene regulation among strains. In addition, we
              identified a novel minimal CRISPR-system in Campylobacter of the
              type-II CRISPR subtype, which relies on the host factor RNase III
              and a trans-encoded sRNA for maturation of crRNAs. This minimal
              system of Campylobacter, which seems active in only some strains,
              employs a unique maturation pathway, since the crRNAs are
              transcribed from individual promoters in the upstream repeats and
              thereby minimize the requirements for the maturation machinery.
              Overall, our study provides new insights into strain-specific
              transcriptome organization and sRNAs, and reveals genes that
              could modulate phenotypic variation among strains despite high
              conservation at the DNA level.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Bacterial transcription attenuation occurs through a
              variety of cis-regulatory elements that control gene expression
              in response to a wide range of signals. The signal-sensing
              structures in attenuators are so diverse and rapidly evolving
              that only a small fraction have been properly annotated and
              characterized to date. Here we apply a broad-spectrum detection
              tool in order to achieve a more complete view of the
              transcriptional attenuation complement of key bacterial species.
              RESULTS: Our protocol seeks gene families with an unusual
              frequency of 5' terminators found across multiple species. Many
              of the detected attenuators are part of annotated elements, such
              as riboswitches or T-boxes, which often operate through
              transcriptional attenuation. However, a significant fraction of
              candidates were not previously characterized in spite of their
              unmistakable footprint. We further characterized some of these
              new elements using sequence and secondary structure analysis. We
              also present elements that may control the expression of several
              non-homologous genes, suggesting co-transcription and response to
              common signals. An important class of such elements, which we
              called mobile attenuators, is provided by 3' terminators of
              insertion sequences or prophages that may be exapted as 5'
              regulators when inserted directly upstream of a cellular gene.
              CONCLUSIONS: We show here that attenuators involve a complex
              landscape of signal-detection structures spanning the entire
              bacterial domain. We discuss possible scenarios through which
              these diverse 5' regulatory structures may arise or evolve.",

              pivotal role in the virulence of bacterial pathogens of humans
              and are also essential for virulence in pathogens of animals and
              plants. Characteristic molecular features of PAI of important
              human pathogens and their role in pathogenesis are described. The
              availability of a large number of genome sequences of pathogenic
              bacteria and their benign relatives currently offers a unique
              opportunity for the identification of novel pathogen-specific
              genomic islands. However, this knowledge has to be complemented
              by improved model systems for the analysis of virulence functions
              of bacterial pathogens. PAI apparently have been acquired during
              the speciation of pathogens from their nonpathogenic or
              environmental ancestors. The acquisition of PAI not only is an
              ancient evolutionary event that led to the appearance of
              bacterial pathogens on a timescale of millions of years but also
              may represent a mechanism that contributes to the appearance of
              new pathogens within a human life span. The acquisition of
              knowledge about PAI, their structure, their mobility, and the

              a better understanding of bacterial evolution and interactions of

              (sRNAs), facilitates base pairing between sRNAs and their mRNA
              targets, and directly binds and regulates translation of certain
              mRNAs. Because sRNAs regulate many stress response pathways in
              bacteria, Hfq is essential for adaptation to different
              environments and growth conditions. The chaperone activities of
              Hfq arise from multipronged RNA binding by three different
              surfaces of the Hfq hexamer. The manner in which the structured
              Sm core of Hfq binds RNA has been well studied, but recent work
              shows that the intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain of Hfq
              modulates sRNA binding, creating a kinetic hierarchy of RNA
              competition for Hfq and ensuring the release of double-stranded

              and genetic experiments reveals how Hfq recognizes its RNA

              recent years, our knowledge of the mechanisms of RNA degradation
              has increased considerably with discovery of the participating
              RNases and analysis of mutants affected in the various

              unclear. Here, we use the metal-reducing bacterium Shewanella
              oneidensis MR-1 and its relatives to study the evolutionary
              conservation of unexpected TSSs. Using high-resolution tiling
              microarrays and 5'-end RNA sequencing, we identified 2,531 TSSs
              in S. oneidensis MR-1, of which 18\% were located inside coding
              sequences (CDSs). Comparative transcriptome analysis with seven
              additional Shewanella species revealed that the majority (76\%)
              of the TSSs within the upstream regions of annotated genes
              (gTSSs) were conserved. Thirty percent of the TSSs that were
              inside genes and on the sense strand (iTSSs) were also conserved.
              Sequence analysis around these iTSSs showed conserved promoter
              motifs, suggesting that many iTSS are under purifying selection.
              Furthermore, conserved iTSSs are enriched for regulatory motifs,
              suggesting that they are regulated, and they tend to eliminate
              polar effects, which confirms that they are functional. In
              contrast, the transcription of antisense TSSs located inside CDSs
              (aTSSs) was significantly less likely to be conserved (22\%).
              However, aTSSs whose transcription was conserved often have
              conserved promoter motifs and drive the expression of nearby
              genes. Overall, our findings demonstrate that some internal TSSs
              are conserved and drive protein expression despite their unusual
              locations, but the majority are not conserved and may reflect
              noisy initiation of transcription rather than a biological
              function. Importance: The first step of gene expression is the
              initiation of transcription from promoters, which have been
              traditionally thought to be located upstream of genes. Recently,
              studies showed that in diverse bacteria, promoters are often
              located inside genes. It has not been clear if these unexpected
              promoters are important to the organism or if they result from
              transcriptional noise. Here, we identify and examine promoters in
              eight related bacterial species. Promoters that lie within genes
              on the sense strand are often conserved as locations and in their
              sequences. Furthermore, these promoters often affect the
              bacterium's growth. Thus, many of these unexpected promoters are
              likely functional. Fewer promoters that lie within genes on the
              antisense strand are conserved, but the conserved ones seem to
              drive the expression of nearby genes.",

              sum of multiple ungapped local alignment segments using a striped
              vector-parallel approach previously described for fast
              Smith/Waterman alignment. MSV scores follow the same statistical

              rapid evaluation of significance of an MSV score and thus
              facilitating its use as a heuristic filter. I also describe a

              Neisseria meningitidis and in related bacterial species,
              transformation by exogenous DNA is regulated by the presence of a
              specific DNA Uptake Sequence (DUS), which is present in thousands
              of copies in the respective genomes. DUS affects transformation
              by limiting DNA uptake and recombination in favour of homologous
              DNA. The specific mechanisms of DUS-dependent genetic
              transformation have remained elusive. Bioinformatic analyses of
              family Neisseriaceae genomes reveal eight distinct variants of
              DUS. These variants are here termed DUS dialects, and their
              effect on interspecies commutation is demonstrated. Each of the
              DUS dialects is remarkably conserved within each species and is
              distributed consistent with a robust Neisseriaceae phylogeny

              a DUS core 5'-CTG-3' is required for transformation and that
              transversions in this core reduce DNA uptake more than two orders

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Non-coding small RNAs (sRNAs) regulate a variety of
              important biological processes across all life domains, including
              bacteria. However, little is known about the functional evolution
              of sRNAs in bacteria, which might occur via changes in sRNA
              structure and/or stability or changes in interactions between
              sRNAs and their associated regulatory networks, including target
              mRNAs. The sRNA Pxr functions as a developmental gatekeeper in
              the model cooperative bacterium Myxococcus xanthus. Specifically,
              Pxr prevents the initiation of fruiting body development when
              nutrients are abundant. Previous work has shown that Pxr appears
              to have a recent origin within a sub-clade of the myxobacteria,
              which allowed us to infer the most recent common ancestor of pxr
              and examine the divergence of Pxr since its origin. RESULTS: To
              test for inter-specific divergence in functional effects, extant
              pxr homologs from several species and their inferred ancestor
              were introduced into an M. xanthus deletion mutant lacking pxr.
              Both the inferred ancestral pxr and all extant alleles from
              species containing only one copy of pxr were found to control
              development in M. xanthus in a qualitatively similar manner to
              the native M. xanthus allele. However, multiple paralogs present
              in Cystobacter species exhibited divergent effects, with two
              paralogs controlling M. xanthus development but two others
              failing to do so. These differences may have occurred through
              changes in gene expression caused by apparent structural
              differences in the sRNA variants encoded by these paralogs.
              CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results suggest that Pxr plays a
              common fundamental role in developmental gene regulation across
              diverse species of myxobacteria but also that the functional
              effects of some Pxr variants may be evolving in some lineages.",

  abstract = "UNLABELLED: The promoter most strongly induced upon activation of
              the Cpx two-component envelope stress response is the cpxP
              promoter. The 3' untranscribed region (UTR) of the cpxP
              transcript is shown to produce a small RNA (sRNA), CpxQ. We
              investigated the role of CpxQ in combating envelope stress.
              Remarkably, the two effectors specified by the transcript are
              deployed to combat distinct stresses in different cellular
              compartments. CpxP acts in both a regulatory negative-feedback
              loop and as an effector that combats periplasmic protein
              misfolding. We find that CpxQ combats toxicity at the inner
              membrane (IM) by downregulating the synthesis of the periplasmic
              chaperone Skp. Our data indicate that this regulation prevents
              Skp from inserting $\beta$-barrel outer membrane proteins (OMPs)
              into the IM, a lethal event that likely collapses the proton
              motive force. Our findings suggest that Skp can fold and directly
              insert OMPs into a lipid bilayer in vivo without the aid of the
              Bam complex. IMPORTANCE: Skp is a well-characterized periplasmic
              chaperone that binds unfolded OMPs. Surprisingly, we find that
              Skp can catalyze the folding and mistargeting of OMPs into the
              inner membrane without the aid of the other cellular proteins
              that normally assemble OMPs. Several OMPs function as diffusion
              pores. Accordingly, their mistargeting is lethal because it
              depolarizes the inner membrane. We show that the most highly
              expressed transcript of the Cpx stress response produces an sRNA
              from the 3' UTR, CpxQ, which combats this potential toxicity by
              downregulating Skp production. Defects in OMP assembly trigger
              the $\sigma$(E)response to upregulate factors, including Skp,
              that promote OMP folding. The Cpx response downregulates
              $\sigma$(E) Our findings reveal that this heretofore puzzling

               bacteria regulate the acquisition, utilization, and storage of
               iron in response to its availability. The iron-dependent ferric
               uptake repressor (Fur) often mediates this iron-responsive
               regulation by both direct and indirect mechanisms. In 2002,
               Masse and Gottesman identified a novel target of Fur-mediated
               regulation in Escherichia coli: a gene encoding a small
               regulatory RNA (sRNA) termed RyhB. Under conditions of
               iron-limitation, RyhB is produced and functions to regulate the

               enzymes, iron acquisition systems, and iron storage factors.
               This pivotal finding provided the missing link between

              riboregulation. In this study, we tried to identify additional

               using microarray analysis and Northern blotting that several

               a major outer membrane protein; luxS, encoding the autoinducer-2

               difference between prokaryotes and eukaryotes or to differences
               in the methods and types of data analyzed--full genome versus
               protein coding sequences. We used simulations to show that the
               method used previously tends to underestimate the expected
               number of inverted repeats. However, this bias is not large and
               cannot explain the excess of inverted repeats observed in real
               data. In contrast, our method is unbiased. When both methods are
               applied to bacterial protein coding sequences they both detect
               an excess of inverted repeats, which is much lower than
               previously reported in whole prokaryotic genomes. This suggests
               that the reported large excess of inverted repeats is due to
               repeats found in intergenic regions. These repeats could be due
               to transcription factor binding sites, or other types of
               repetitive DNA, on opposite strands of the DNA sequence. In
               contrast, the smaller, but significant, excess of inverted
               repeats that we report in protein coding sequences may be due to
               sequence-directed mutagenesis (SDM). SDM is a process where one
               copy of a small, imperfect, inverted repeat corrects the other
               copy via strand misalignment, resulting in a perfect repeat and
               a series of mutations. We show by simulation that even very low

              infection biology has relied on forward genetics for many of its
              advances, defining phenotype in terms of replication in model
              systems. However, many known virulence factors fail to produce
              robust phenotypes, particularly in the systems most amenable to
              genetic manipulation, such as cell-culture models. This has
              particularly been limiting for the study of the bacterial

              providing a 'molecular phenotype', defined in terms of the
              specific transcriptional dysregulation in the infection system

              simultaneous RNA sequencing of host and pathogen during

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: NCRNAs (noncoding RNAs) play important roles in many
              biological processes. Existing genome-scale ncRNA search tools
              identify ncRNAs in local sequence alignments generated by
              conventional sequence comparison methods. However, some types of
              ncRNA lack strong sequence conservation and tend to be missed or
              mis-aligned by conventional sequence comparison. RESULTS: In this
              paper, we propose an ncRNA identification framework that is
              complementary to existing sequence comparison tools. By
              integrating a filtration step based on Hamming distance and ncRNA
              alignment programs such as FOLDALIGN or PLAST-ncRNA, the proposed
              ncRNA search framework can identify ncRNAs that lack strong
              sequence conservation. In addition, as the ratio of transition
              and transversion mutation is often used as a discriminative
              feature for functional ncRNA identification, we incorporate this
              feature into the filtration step using a coding strategy. We
              apply Hamming distance seeds to ncRNA search in the intergenic
              regions of human and mouse genomes and between the Burkholderia
              cenocepacia J2315 genome and the Ralstonia solanacearum genome.
              The experimental results demonstrate that a carefully designed
              Hamming distance seed can achieve better sensitivity in searching
              for poorly conserved ncRNAs than conventional sequence comparison
              tools. CONCLUSIONS: Hamming distance seeds provide better
              sensitivity as a filtration strategy for genome-wide ncRNA
              homology search than the existing seeding strategies used in
              BLAST-like tools. By combining Hamming distance seeds matching
              and ncRNA alignment, we are able to find ncRNAs with sequence
              similarities below 60\%.",

               question of the cellular substrate pool of SRP and the molecular

               Escherichia coli at amino acid resolution, by sequencing
               messenger RNA footprints of ribosome--nascent-chain complexes
               associated with SRP. SRP, on the basis of its strong preference
               for hydrophobic transmembrane domains (TMDs), constitutes a
               compartment-specific targeting factor for nascent inner membrane
               proteins (IMPs) that efficiently excludes
               signal-sequence-containing precursors of periplasmic and outer
               membrane proteins. SRP associates with hydrophobic TMDs enriched
               in consecutive stretches of hydrophobic and bulky aromatic amino
               acids immediately on their emergence from the ribosomal exit
               tunnel. By contrast with current models, N-terminal TMDs are
               frequently skipped and TMDs internal to the polypeptide sequence
               are selectively recognized. Furthermore, SRP binds several TMDs
               in many multi-spanning membrane proteins, suggesting cycles of

               (TF), which has a distinct substrate pool and acts at different
               stages during translation. Overall, our proteome-wide data set

              publicly available RNA-seq datasets spanning 37 different Archaea
              and Bacteria. Using comparative tools, we identify close to a
              thousand highly-expressed candidate noncoding RNAs. However, our

              is strongly dependent on phylogenetic sampling. Surprisingly, and
              in stark contrast to protein-coding genes, the phylogenetic
              window for effective use of comparative methods is perversely
              narrow: aggregating public datasets only produced one

  abstract  = "Prokaryotic genomes encode a plethora of small noncoding RNAs
               (ncRNAs) that fine-tune the expression of specific genes. The
               vast majority of known bacterial ncRNAs are encoded from within
               intergenic regions, where their expression is controlled by
               promoter and terminator elements, similarly to protein-coding
               genes. In addition, recent studies have shown that functional
               ncRNAs can also be derived from gene 3' untranslated regions
               (3'UTRs) via an alternative biogenesis pathway, in which the
               ncRNA segment is separated from the mRNA via RNase cleavage.
               Here, we report the detection of a large set of decay-generated
               noncoding RNAs (decRNAs), many of which are completely embedded
               within protein-coding mRNA regions rather than in the UTRs. We
               show that these decRNAs are ``carved out'' of the mRNA through
               the action of RNase E and that they are predicted to fold into
               highly stable RNA structures, similar to those of known ncRNAs.
               A subset of these decRNAs is predicted to interact with Hfq or
               ProQ or both, which act as ncRNA chaperones, and some decRNAs
               display evolutionarily conserved sequences and conserved
               expression patterns between different species. These results
               suggest that mRNA protein-coding regions may harbor a large set
               of potentially functional small RNAs.IMPORTANCE Bacteria and
               archaea utilize regulatory small noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) to
               control the expression of specific genetic programs. These
               ncRNAs are almost exclusively encoded within intergenic regions
               and are independently transcribed. Here, we report on a large
               set ncRNAs that are ``carved out'' from within the
               protein-coding regions of Escherichia coli mRNAs by cellular
               RNases. These protected mRNA fragments fold into energetically
               stable RNA structures, reminiscent of those of intergenic
               regulatory ncRNAs. In addition, a subset of these ncRNAs
               coprecipitate with the major ncRNA chaperones Hfq and ProQ and
               display evolutionarily conserved sequences and conserved
               expression patterns between different bacterial species. Our
               data suggest that protein-coding genes can potentially act as a
               reservoir of regulatory ncRNAs.",

              used HTPS to discover the Salmonella RNAs that are targeted by
              the common bacterial Sm-like protein, Hfq. Initial transcriptomic
              analysis revealed that Hfq controls the expression of almost a
              fifth of all Salmonella genes, including several horizontally
              acquired pathogenicity islands (SPI-1, -2, -4, -5), two sigma
              factor regulons, and the flagellar gene cascade. Subsequent HTPS

              co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) with epitope-tagged Hfq or control
              coIP, identified 727 mRNAs that are Hfq-bound in vivo. The cDNA

              than doubled the number of sRNAs known to be expressed in
              Salmonella to 64; about half of these are associated with Hfq.
              Our analysis explained aspects of the pleiotropic effects of Hfq
              loss-of-function. Specifically, we found that the mRNAs of hilD
              (master regulator of the SPI-1 invasion genes) and flhDC

               for proper transcript termination: intrinsic termination and

               signals directly encoded within the DNA template and nascent

  abstract  = "Two important problems affect the ability of asexual populations
               to accumulate beneficial mutations and hence to adapt. First,
               clonal interference causes some beneficial mutations to be
               outcompeted by more-fit mutations that occur in the same genetic
               background. Second, multiple mutations occur in some
               individuals, so even mutations of large effect can be
               outcompeted unless they occur in a good genetic background that
               contains other beneficial mutations. In this article, we use a
               Monte Carlo simulation to study how these two factors influence
               the adaptation of asexual populations. We find that the results
               depend qualitatively on the shape of the distribution of the
               fitness effects of possible beneficial mutations. When this
               distribution falls off slower than exponentially, clonal
               interference alone reasonably describes which mutations dominate

               evolutionary dynamics. When the distribution falls off faster
               than exponentially, an analysis based on multiple mutations is
               more appropriate. Using our simulations, we are able to explore
               the limits of validity of both of these approaches, and we

              RNA polymerase with exchangeable $\sigma$-subunits and multiple
              transcription factors. A typical promoter region contains one or
              several overlapping promoters. In the latter case promoters have
              the same or different $\sigma$-specificity and are often
              subjected to different regulatory stimuli. Genes, transcribed
              from multiple promoters, have on average higher expression
              levels. However, recently in the genome of Escherichia coli we
              found 78 regions with an extremely large number of potential
              transcription start points (promoter islands, PIs). It was shown
              that all PIs interact with RNA polymerase in vivo and are able to
              form transcriptionally competent open complexes both in vitro and
              in vivo but their transcriptional activity measured by
              oligonucleotide microarrays was very low, if any. Here we
              confirmed transcriptional defectiveness of PIs by analyzing the
              5'-end specific RNA-seq data, but showed their ability to produce
              short oligos (9-14 bases). This combination of functional
              properties indicated a deliberate suppression of transcriptional
              activity within PIs. According to our data this suppression may
              be due to a specific conformation of the DNA double helix, which
              provides an ideal platform for interaction with both RNA
              polymerase and the histone-like nucleoid protein H-NS. The

              optimized by evolution for staying in a heterochromatin-like
              state. Since almost all promoter islands are associated with
              horizontally acquired genes, we offer them as specific components
              of bacterial evolution involved in acquisition of foreign genetic
              material by turning off the expression of toxic or useless aliens
              or by providing optimal promoter for beneficial genes. The

              of research that has made rapid progress in the past decade
              thanks to the genomics revolution. Indeed, recent work has
              provided initial whole-genome views of the different types of new
              genes for a large number of different organisms. The array of
              mechanisms underlying the origin of new genes is compelling,
              extending way beyond the traditionally well-studied source of
              gene duplication. Thus, it was shown that novel genes also
              regularly arose from messenger RNAs of ancestral genes,
              protein-coding genes metamorphosed into new RNA genes, genomic
              parasites were co-opted as new genes, and that both protein and
              RNA genes were composed from scratch (i.e., from previously
              nonfunctional sequences). These mechanisms then also contributed
              to the formation of numerous novel chimeric gene structures.
              Detailed functional investigations uncovered different
              evolutionary pathways that led to the emergence of novel
              functions from these newly minted sequences and, with respect to

              These molecules can integrate multiple cellular signals to
              control specific target mRNAs. The recent development of
              high-throughput methods tremendously helped to characterize the
              full targetome of sRNAs. Using MS2-affinity purification coupled
              with RNA sequencing (MAPS) technology, we reveal the targetomes
              of two sRNAs, CyaR and RprA. Interestingly, both CyaR and RprA
              interact with the 5'-UTR of hdeD mRNA, which encodes an
              acid-resistance membrane protein. We demonstrate that CyaR
              classically binds to the RBS of hdeD, interfering with
              translational initiation. We identified an A/U-rich motif on
              hdeD, which is bound by the RNA chaperone Hfq. Our results
              indicate that binding of this motif by Hfq is required for
              CyaR-induced degradation of hdeD mRNA. Additional data suggest
              that two molecules of RprA must bind the 5'-UTR of hdeD to block
              translation initiation. Surprisingly, while both CyaR and RprA
              sRNAs bind to the same motif on hdeD mRNA, RprA solely acts at
              the translational level, leaving the target RNA intact. By
              interchanging the seed region of CyaR and RprA sRNAs, we also
              swap their regulatory behavior. These results suggest that slight
              changes in the seed region could modulate the regulation of
              target mRNAs.",

              GEIs are discrete DNA segments, some of which are mobile and

              posttranscriptional regulators involved in the control of
              bacterial lifestyle and adaptation to stressful conditions.
              Although chemical stress due to the toxicity of precursor and
              product compounds is frequently encountered in microbial
              bioprocessing applications, the involvement of sRNAs in this
              process is not well understood. We have used RNA sequencing to
              map sRNA expression in E. coli under chemical stress and high
              cell density fermentation conditions with the aim of identifying
              sRNAs involved in the transcriptional response and those with
              potential roles in stress tolerance. RESULTS: RNA sequencing
              libraries were prepared from RNA isolated from E. coli K-12
              MG1655 cells grown under high cell density fermentation
              conditions or subjected to chemical stress with twelve compounds
              including four organic solvent-like compounds, four organic
              acids, two amino acids, geraniol and decanoic acid. We have
              discovered 253 novel intergenic transcripts with this approach,
              adding to the roughly 200 intergenic sRNAs previously reported in
              E. coli. There are eighty-four differentially expressed sRNAs
              during fermentation, of which the majority are novel, supporting
              possible regulatory roles for these transcripts in adaptation
              during different fermentation stages. There are a total of 139
              differentially expressed sRNAs under chemical stress conditions,
              where twenty-nine exhibit significant expression changes in
              multiple tested conditions, suggesting that they may be involved
              in a more general chemical stress response. Among those with
              known functions are sRNAs involved in regulation of outer
              membrane proteins, iron availability, maintaining envelope
              homeostasis, as well as sRNAs incorporated into complex networks
              controlling motility and biofilm formation. CONCLUSIONS: This
              study has used deep sequencing to reveal a wealth of hitherto
              undescribed sRNAs in E. coli and provides an atlas of sRNA
              expression during seventeen different growth and stress
              conditions. Although the number of novel sRNAs with regulatory
              functions is unknown, several exhibit specific expression
              patterns during high cell density fermentation and are
              differentially expressed in the presence of multiple chemicals,
              suggesting they may play regulatory roles during these stress
              conditions. These novel sRNAs, together with specific known
              sRNAs, are candidates for improving stress tolerance and our
              understanding of the E. coli regulatory network during fed-batch

              In contrast, Rho-dependent terminators have more loosely defined
              characteristics and are thought to terminate in a diffuse manner.
              While transcripts ending in an intrinsic terminator are protected
              from 3'-5' exonuclease digestion due to the stem-loop structure
              of the terminator, it remains unclear what protects Rho-dependent

              landscape of two major bacterial post-transcriptional regulators,
              Hfq and CsrA, in the model pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium. By
              detecting binding sites at single-nucleotide resolution, we

               now enhancing fitness no matter how they arose). Biologists have
               often failed to recognize the potential confusion between these
               different definitions because we have tended to view natural
               selection as so dominant among evolutionary mechanisms that
               historical process and current product become one. Yet if many
               features of organisms are non-adapted, but available for useful
               cooptation in descendants, then an important concept has no name
               in our lexicon (and unnamed ideas generally remain
               unconsidered): features that now enhance fitness but were not

  author   = "Neme, Rafik and Tautz, Diethard",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: New gene emergence is so far assumed to be mostly
              driven by duplication and divergence of existing genes. The
              possibility that entirely new genes could emerge out of the
              non-coding genomic background was long thought to be almost
              negligible. With the increasing availability of fully sequenced
              genomes across broad scales of phylogeny, it has become possible
              to systematically study the origin of new genes over time and
              thus revisit this question. RESULTS: We have used
              phylostratigraphy to assess trends of gene evolution across
              successive phylogenetic phases, using mostly the well-annotated
              mouse genome as a reference. We find several significant general
              trends and confirm them for three other vertebrate genomes
              (humans, zebrafish and stickleback). Younger genes are shorter,
              both with respect to gene length, as well as to open reading
              frame length. They contain also fewer exons and have fewer
              recognizable domains. Average exon length, on the other hand,
              does not change much over time. Only the most recently evolved
              genes have longer exons and they are often associated with active
              promotor regions, i.e. are part of bidirectional promotors. We
              have also revisited the possibility that de novo evolution of
              genes could occur even within existing genes, by making use of an
              alternative reading frame (overprinting). We find several cases
              among the annotated Ensembl ORFs, where the new reading frame has
              emerged at a higher phylostratigraphic level than the original
              one. We discuss some of these overprinted genes, which include
              also the Hoxa9 gene where an alternative reading frame covering
              the homeobox has emerged within the lineage leading to rodents
              and primates (Euarchontoglires). CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that the
              overall trends of gene emergence are more compatible with a de
              novo evolution model for orphan genes than a general
              duplication-divergence model. Hence de novo evolution of genes
              appears to have occurred continuously throughout evolutionary
              time and should therefore be considered as a general mechanism
              for the emergence of new gene functions.",

              correlated with genome expansion in eukaryotes but with genome
              contraction in bacteria, suggesting that these two groups of
              organisms experience vastly different mutational inputs and
              selective constraints. To determine the contribution of small
              insertion and deletion events to the differences in genome
              organization between eukaryotes and prokaryotes, we
              systematically surveyed 17 taxonomic groups across the three
              domains of life. Based on over 5,000 indel events in noncoding
              regions, we found that deletional events outnumbered insertions
              in all groups examined. The extent of deletional bias, when
              measured by the total length of insertions to deletions, revealed
              a marked disparity between eukaryotes and prokaryotes, whereas
              the ratio was close to one in the three eukaryotic groups
              examined, deletions outweighed insertions by at least a factor of
              10 in most prokaryotes. Moreover, the strength of deletional bias
              is associated with the proportion of coding regions in
              prokaryotic genomes. Considering that genetic drift is a
              stochastic process and does not discriminate the exact nature of
              mutations, the degree of bias toward deletions provides an
              explanation to the differential responses of eukaryotes and
              prokaryotes to elevated levels of drift. Furthermore, deletional
              bias, rather than natural selection, is the primary mechanism by

  abstract = "UNLABELLED: In this study, we sought to characterize the targets
              of the abundant Listeria monocytogenes noncoding RNA Rli31, which
              is required for L. monocytogenes lysozyme resistance and
              pathogenesis. Whole-genome sequencing of lysozyme-resistant
              suppressor strains identified loss-of-expression mutations in the
              promoter of spoVG, and deletion of spoVG rescued lysozyme
              sensitivity and attenuation in vivo of the rli31 mutant. SpoVG
              was demonstrated to be an RNA-binding protein that interacted
              with Rli31 in vitro. The relationship between Rli31 and SpoVG is
              multifaceted, as both the spoVG-encoded protein and the spoVG
              5′-untranslated region interacted with Rli31. In addition, we
              observed that spoVG-deficient bacteria were nonmotile in soft
              agar and suppressor mutations that restored swarming motility
              were identified in the gene encoding a major RNase in
              Gram-positive bacteria, RNase J1. Collectively, these findings
              suggest that SpoVG is similar to global posttranscriptional
              regulators, a class of RNA-binding proteins that interact with
              noncoding RNA, regulate genes in concert with RNases, and control
              pleiotropic aspects of bacterial physiology. IMPORTANCE: spoVG is
              widely conserved among bacteria; however, the function of this
              gene has remained unclear since its initial characterization in
              1977. Mutation of spoVG impacts various phenotypes in
              Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin resistance, capsule
              formation, and enzyme secretion in Staphylococcus aureus and also
              asymmetric cell division, hemolysin production, and sporulation
              in Bacillus subtilis. Here, we demonstrate that spoVG mutant
              strains of Listeria monocytogenes are hyper-lysozyme resistant,
              hypervirulent, nonmotile, and misregulate genes controlling
              carbon metabolism. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SpoVG is an
              RNA-binding protein. These findings suggest that SpoVG has a role
              in L. monocytogenes, and perhaps in other bacteria, as a global
              gene regulator. Posttranscriptional gene regulators help bacteria
              adapt to various environments and coordinate differing aspects of
              bacterial physiology. SpoVG may help the organism coordinate
              environmental growth and virulence to survive as a facultative
              pathogen.",

              coding genes, structural RNAs are more difficult to identify

              which harness both sequence and structural conservation when
              searching for RNA homologs. Thanks to the added statistical
              signal inherent in the secondary structure conservation of many

              genomic regions remain little understood. The IsrK sRNA of
              Gifsy-1 prophage of Salmonella belongs to the latter class. This
              regulatory RNA exists in two isoforms. The first forms, when a
              portion of transcripts originating from isrK promoter
              reads-through the IsrK transcription-terminator producing a
              translationally inactive mRNA target. Acting in trans, the second
              isoform, short IsrK RNA, binds the inactive transcript rendering
              it translationally active. By switching on translation of the
              first isoform, short IsrK indirectly activates the production of
              AntQ, an antiterminator protein located upstream of isrK.
              Expression of antQ globally interferes with transcription
              termination resulting in bacterial growth arrest and ultimately

              co-expression of the transcription termination factor, Rho, or
              RNase H, which protects genomic DNA from breaks by resolving
              R-loops. We propose that AntQ causes conflicts between
              transcription and replication machineries and thus promotes DNA
              damage. The isrK locus represents a unique example of an

               cholerae is significantly larger than in E. coli. As in E. coli,

              bacteria and play key roles in many important physiological and
              adaptation processes. Studying their evolution and screening for
              events of coevolution with other genomic features is a powerful
              way to better understand their origin and assess a common
              functional or adaptive relationship between them. However,
              evolution and coevolution of sRNAs with coding genes have been
              sparsely investigated in bacterial pathogens. RESULTS: We
              designed a robust and generic phylogenomics approach that detects
              correlated evolution between sRNAs and protein-coding genes using
              their observed and inferred patterns of presence-absence in a set
              of annotated genomes. We applied this approach on 79 complete
              genomes of the Listeria genus and identified fifty-two accessory
              sRNAs, of which most were present in the Listeria common ancestor
              and lost during Listeria evolution. We detected significant
              coevolution between 23 sRNA and 52 coding genes and inferred the
              Listeria sRNA-coding genes coevolution network. We characterized
              a main hub of 12 sRNAs that coevolved with genes encoding cell

              interaction, consistent with recent findings on known
              pathogenicity actors. We highlight four sRNAs coevolving with

  abstract = "Post-transcriptional control by small regulatory RNA (sRNA) is
              critical for rapid adaptive processes. sRNAs can directly
              modulate mRNA degradation in Proteobacteria without interfering
              with translation. However, Firmicutes have a fundamentally
              different set of ribonucleases for mRNA degradation and whether
              sRNAs can regulate the activity of these enzymes is an open
              question. We show that Bacillus subtilis RoxS, a major
              trans-acting sRNA shared with Staphylococus aureus, prevents
              degradation of the yflS mRNA, encoding a malate transporter. In
              the presence of malate, RoxS transiently escapes from repression
              by the NADH-sensitive transcription factor Rex and binds to the
              extreme 5'-end of yflS mRNA. This impairs the 5'-3'
              exoribonuclease activity of RNase J1, increasing the half-life of
              the primary transcript and concomitantly enhancing ribosome
              binding to increase expression of the transporter. Globally, the
              different targets regulated by RoxS suggest that it helps
              readjust the cellular NAD(+)/NADH balance when perturbed by
              different stimuli.",
