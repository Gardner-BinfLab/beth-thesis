  abstract  = "Modern bacteria regulate the expression of their genes through a
               spectrum of mechanisms ranging from the very simple to those
               that are highly complex. The regulatory mechanisms have evolved
               in concert with the means to detect changes to the physical or
               chemical environment, equipping the organism to respond to
               change. Regulation can be imposed at each stage of gene
               expression, and the networking of genes through coordinated
               control makes for multidimensional relationships that vary in
               time and space. Understanding how this regulatory complexity
               evolved is not a trivial matter, but it can be attempted. In one
               popular view, an `RNA world' may have preceded the modern one
               with its DNA-based genomes. Looking for evidence of RNA-based
               gene regulation has been very fruitful and shows that gene
               control at this level is still very much in use: the conversion
               of genetic information held in RNA into protein by translation
               involves processes that are open to control at several levels.
               In DNA-based genomes, transcription is a fundamental process,
               and over evolutionary time bacterial cells have invested heavily
               in mechanisms that control it. Mechanisms that influence the
               activity of RNA polymerase are legion but fall into two
               categories: those that impede and those that assist the
               polymerase in the process of reading genetic information. It
               seems that simply turning genes on or off is rarely sufficient:
               it was necessary to evolve mechanisms for tuning transcription
               to the needs of the cell to promote survival, regardless of the
               size or level of sophistication of the organism's genome. These
               regulatory mechanisms have evolved in ways that make their
               operations `noisy', and this noise can be useful in generating
               physiological variety among genetically identical bacterial
               cells. It is becoming clear that the evolutionary forces that
               shape the bacterial nucleoid also guide the development of gene
               regulatory elements. For this reason the evolution of bacterial
               gene regulatory mechanisms will also be considered in the
               context of bacterial genome architecture.",

abstract = "A computer adaptable method for finding similarities in the amino acid sequences of two proteins has been developed. From these findings it is possible to determine whether significant homology exists between the proteins. This information is used to trace their possible evolutionary development. The maximum match is a number dependent upon the similarity of the sequences. One of its definitions is the largest number of amino acids of one protein that can be matched with those of a second protein allowing for all possible interruptions in either of the sequences. While the interruptions give rise to a very large number of comparisons, the method efficiently excludes from consideration those comparisons that cannot contribute to the maximum match. Comparisons are made from the smallest unit of significance, a pair of amino acids, one from each protein. All possible pairs are represented by a two-dimensional array, and all possible comparisons are represented by pathways through the array. For this maximum match only certain of the possible pathways must be evaluated. A numerical value, one in this case, is assigned to every cell in the array representing like amino acids. The maximum match is the largest number that would result from summing the cell values of every pathway."

Firstly, individual weights are assigned to each sequence in a partial alignment in order to down-weight near-duplicate sequences and up-weight the most divergent ones. Secondly, amino acid substitution matrices are varied at different alignment stages according to the divergence of the sequences to be aligned. Thirdly, residue-specific gap penalties and locally reduced gap penalties in hydrophilic regions encourage new gaps in potential loop regions rather than regular secondary structure. Fourthly, positions in early alignments where gaps have been opened receive locally reduced gap penalties to encourage the opening up of new gaps at these positions.

However, the very beginnings of bioinformatics occurred more than 50 years ago, when desktop computers were still a hypothesis and DNA could not yet be sequenced. The foundations of bioinformatics were laid in the early 1960s with the application of computational methods to protein sequence analysis (notably, de novo sequence assembly, biological sequence databases and substitution models). Later on, DNA analysis also emerged due to parallel advances in (i) molecular biology methods, which allowed easier manipulation of DNA, as well as its sequencing, and (ii) computer science, which saw the rise of increasingly miniaturized and more powerful computers, as well as novel software better suited to handle bioinformatics tasks. In the 1990s through the 2000s, major improvements in sequencing technology, along with reduced costs, gave rise to an exponential increase of data. The arrival of ‘Big Data’ has laid out new challenges in terms of data mining and management, calling for more expertise from computer science into the field. Coupled with an ever-increasing amount of bioinformatics tools, biological Big Data had (and continues to have) profound implications on the predictive power and reproducibility of bioinformatics results. To overcome this issue, universities are now fully integrating this discipline into the curriculum of biology students. Recent subdisciplines such as synthetic biology, systems biology and whole-cell modeling have emerged from the ever-increasing complementarity between computer science and biology.}",

               discoveries of important biological or medical benefit.
               Sequencing projects have traditionally used long (400--800 base
               pair) reads, but the existence of reference sequences for the
               human and many other genomes makes it possible to develop new,
               fast approaches to re-sequencing, whereby shorter reads are
               compared to a reference to identify intraspecies genetic
               variation. Here we report an approach that generates several
               billion bases of accurate nucleotide sequence per experiment at
               low cost. Single molecules of DNA are attached to a flat
               surface, amplified in situ and used as templates for synthetic
               sequencing with fluorescent reversible terminator
               deoxyribonucleotides. Images of the surface are analysed to
               generate high-quality sequence. We demonstrate application of
               this approach to human genome sequencing on flow-sorted X
               chromosomes and then scale the approach to determine the genome
               sequence of a male Yoruba from Ibadan, Nigeria. We build an
               accurate consensus sequence from >30$\times$ average depth of
               paired 35-base reads. We characterize four million
               single-nucleotide polymorphisms and four hundred thousand
               structural variants, many of which were previously unknown. Our
               approach is effective for accurate, rapid and economical

              activity in bacterial cells, we have devised an equivalent
              technique optimized for studying complete prokaryotic
              transcriptomes that minimizes the manipulation of the RNA sample.
              This new approach uses Illumina technology to sequence
              single-stranded (ss) cDNA, generating information on both the
              direction and level of transcription throughout the genome. The
              protocol, and associated data analysis programs, are freely

              We also show that there is a high correlation between the level

              double-stranded-cDNA sequencing, indicting that ss-cDNA

However, numerous technical or computational challenges in de novo assembly still remain, although many bright ideas and heuristics have been suggested to tackle the challenges in both experimental and computational settings. In this review, we categorize de novo assemblers on the basis of the type of de Bruijn graphs (Hamiltonian and Eulerian) and discuss the challenges of de novo assembly for short NGS reads regarding computational complexity and assembly ambiguity. Then, we discuss how the limitations of the short reads can be overcome by using a single-molecule sequencing platform that generates long reads of up to several kilobases. In fact, the long read assembly has caused a paradigm shift in whole-genome assembly in terms of algorithms and supporting steps. We also summarize (i) hybrid assemblies using both short and long reads and (ii) overlap-based assemblies for long reads and discuss their challenges and future prospects.

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the
              new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast
              and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash
              table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is
              accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from
              a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped
              alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for
              alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The
              speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to
              the resequencing of hundreds of individuals. RESULTS: We
              implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read
              alignment package that is based on backward search with
              Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short
              sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the
              human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both
              base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and
              color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both
              simulated and real data suggest that BWA is approximately 10-20x

    title={RSEM: accurate transcript quantification from RNA-Seq data with or without a reference genome},
    volume={12},
    ISSN={1471-2105},
    abstractNote={BACKGROUND: RNA-Seq is revolutionizing the way transcript abundances are measured. A key challenge in transcript quantification from RNA-Seq data is the handling of reads that map to multiple genes or isoforms. This issue is particularly important for quantification with de novo transcriptome assemblies in the absence of sequenced genomes, as it is difficult to determine which transcripts are isoforms of the same gene. A second significant issue is the design of RNA-Seq experiments, in terms of the number of reads, read length, and whether reads come from one or both ends of cDNA fragments. RESULTS: We present RSEM, an user-friendly software package for quantifying gene and isoform abundances from single-end or paired-end RNA-Seq data. RSEM outputs abundance estimates, 95\% credibility intervals, and visualization files and can also simulate RNA-Seq data. In contrast to other existing tools, the software does not require a reference genome. Thus, in combination with a de novo transcriptome assembler, RSEM enables accurate transcript quantification for species without sequenced genomes. On simulated and real data sets, RSEM has superior or comparable performance to quantification methods that rely on a reference genome. Taking advantage of RSEM’s ability to effectively use ambiguously-mapping reads, we show that accurate gene-level abundance estimates are best obtained with large numbers of short single-end reads. On the other hand, estimates of the relative frequencies of isoforms within single genes may be improved through the use of paired-end reads, depending on the number of possible splice forms for each gene. CONCLUSIONS: RSEM is an accurate and user-friendly software tool for quantifying transcript abundances from RNA-Seq data. As it does not rely on the existence of a reference genome, it is particularly useful for quantification with de novo transcriptome assemblies. In addition, RSEM has enabled valuable guidance for cost-efficient design of quantification experiments with RNA-Seq, which is currently relatively expensive.},

The volume and complexity of data from RNA-seq experiments necessitate scalable, fast and mathematically principled analysis software. TopHat and Cufflinks are free, open-source software tools for gene discovery and comprehensive expression analysis of high-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Together, they allow biologists to identify new genes and new splice variants of known ones, as well as compare gene and transcript expression under two or more conditions. This protocol describes in detail how to use TopHat and Cufflinks to perform such analyses. It also covers several accessory tools and utilities that aid in managing data, including CummeRbund, a tool for visualizing RNA-seq analysis results. Although the procedure assumes basic informatics skills, these tools assume little to no background with RNA-seq analysis and are meant for novices and experts alike. The protocol begins with raw sequencing reads and produces a transcriptome assembly, lists of differentially expressed and regulated genes and transcripts, and publication-quality visualizations of analysis results. The protocol’s execution time depends on the volume of transcriptome sequencing data and available computing resources but takes less than 1 d of computer time for typical experiments and ∼1 h of hands-on time.},

It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences.

              reconstruct the metabolic network and makes the output easily

    volume={44}, ISSN={0305-1048},
    abstractNote={Recent technological advances have opened unprecedented opportunities for large-scale sequencing and analysis of populations of pathogenic species in disease outbreaks, as well as for large-scale diversity studies aimed at expanding our knowledge across the whole domain of prokaryotes. To meet the challenge of timely interpretation of structure, function and meaning of this vast genetic information, a comprehensive approach to automatic genome annotation is critically needed. In collaboration with Georgia Tech, NCBI has developed a new approach to genome annotation that combines alignment based methods with methods of predicting protein-coding and RNA genes and other functional elements directly from sequence. A new gene finding tool, GeneMarkS+, uses the combined evidence of protein and RNA placement by homology as an initial map of annotation to generate and modify ab initio gene predictions across the whole genome. Thus, the new NCBI’s Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP) relies more on sequence similarity when confident comparative data are available, while it relies more on statistical predictions in the absence of external evidence. The pipeline provides a framework for generation and analysis of annotation on the full breadth of prokaryotic taxonomy. For additional information on PGAP see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_prok/ and the NCBI Handbook, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK174280/.},

    volume={23},
    ISSN={1367-4803},
    abstractNote={MOTIVATION: The Glimmer gene-finding software has been successfully used for finding genes in bacteria, archaea and viruses representing hundreds of species. We describe several major changes to the Glimmer system, including improved methods for identifying both coding regions and start codons. We also describe a new module of Glimmer that can distinguish host and endosymbiont DNA. This module was developed in response to the discovery that eukaryotic genome sequencing projects sometimes inadvertently capture the DNA of intracellular bacteria living in the host. RESULTS: The new methods dramatically reduce the rate of false-positive predictions, while maintaining Glimmer’s 99\% sensitivity rate at detecting genes in most species, and they find substantially more correct start sites, as measured by comparisons to known and well-curated genes. We show that our interpolated Markov model (IMM) DNA discriminator correctly separated 99\% of the sequences in a recent genome project that produced a mixture of sequences from the bacterium Prochloron didemni and its sea squirt host, Lissoclinum patella.

    abstractNote={BACKGROUND: The quality of automated gene prediction in microbial organisms has improved steadily over the past decade, but there is still room for improvement. Increasing the number of correct identifications, both of genes and of the translation initiation sites for each gene, and reducing the overall number of false positives, are all desirable goals. RESULTS: With our years of experience in manually curating genomes for the Joint Genome Institute, we developed a new gene prediction algorithm called Prodigal (PROkaryotic DYnamic programming Gene-finding ALgorithm). With Prodigal, we focused specifically on the three goals of improved gene structure prediction, improved translation initiation site recognition, and reduced false positives. We compared the results of Prodigal to existing gene-finding methods to demonstrate that it met each of these objectives. CONCLUSION: We built a fast, lightweight, open source gene prediction program called Prodigal http://compbio.ornl.gov/prodigal/. Prodigal achieved good results compared to existing methods, and we believe it will be a valuable asset to automated microbial annotation pipelines.},

    volume={34},
    ISSN={0737-4038},
    abstractNote={Orthology assignment is ideally suited for functional inference. However, because predicting orthology is computationally intensive at large scale, and most pipelines are relatively inaccessible (e.g., new assignments only available through database updates), less precise homology-based functional transfer is still the default for (meta-)genome annotation. We, therefore, developed eggNOG-mapper, a tool for functional annotation of large sets of sequences based on fast orthology assignments using precomputed clusters and phylogenies from the eggNOG database. To validate our method, we benchmarked Gene Ontology (GO) predictions against two widely used homology-based approaches: BLAST and InterProScan. Orthology filters applied to BLAST results reduced the rate of false positive assignments by 11\%, and increased the ratio of experimentally validated terms recovered over all terms assigned per protein by 15\%. Compared with InterProScan, eggNOG-mapper achieved similar proteome coverage and precision while predicting, on average, 41 more terms per protein and increasing the rate of experimentally validated terms recovered over total term assignments per protein by 35\%. EggNOG-mapper predictions scored within the top-5 methods in the three GO categories using the CAFA2 NK-partial benchmark. Finally, we evaluated eggNOG-mapper for functional annotation of metagenomics data, yielding better performance than interProScan. eggNOG-mapper runs ∼15× faster than BLAST and at least 2.5× faster than InterProScan. The tool is available standalone and as an online service at http://eggnog-mapper.embl.de.},

              with their associated RNAs, form small ribonucleoprotein (RNP)
              complexes important in multiple aspects of gene regulation.
              Comprehensive knowledge of the RNA components of Sm RNPs is
              critical for understanding their functions. RESULTS: We developed
              a multi-targeting RNA-immunoprecipitation sequencing (RIP-seq)
              strategy to reliably identify Sm-associated RNAs from Drosophila
              ovaries and cultured human cells. Using this method, we
              discovered three major categories of Sm-associated transcripts:
              small nuclear (sn)RNAs, small Cajal body (sca)RNAs and mRNAs.
              Additional RIP-PCR analysis showed both ubiquitous and
              tissue-specific interactions. We provide evidence that the
              mRNA-Sm interactions are mediated by snRNPs, and that one of the
              mechanisms of interaction is via base pairing. Moreover, the
              Sm-associated mRNAs are mature, indicating a splicing-independent
              function for Sm RNPs. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the
              first comprehensive analysis of eukaryotic Sm-containing RNPs,

    abstractNote={The tmRNA system performs translational surveillance and ribosome rescue in all eubacteria and some eukaryotic organelles. This system intervenes when ribosomes read to the 3’ end of an mRNA or pause at internal codons with subsequent mRNA cleavage. A complex of alanyl-tmRNA (which functions as a tRNA and mRNA), SmpB protein, and EF-TucGTP binds stalled ribosomes, the nascent polypeptide is transferred to the alanine on tmRNA, and translation switches from the original message to a short tmRNA open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a degradation tag. Translation of the ORF and normal termination releases the tagged polypeptide for degradation and permits disassembly and recycling of ribosomal subunits for new rounds of protein synthesis. Structural and biochemical studies suggest mechanisms that keep tmRNA from interrupting normal translation and target ribosomes stalled with very short 3' mRNA extensions. Additional biological roles of tmRNA include stress management and the regulation of transcriptional circuits.},

Four years of experience have not only demonstrated the applicability of the approach, but also helped us to identify limitations of the current implementation. RNAz 2.0 provides significant improvements in two respects: (1) The accuracy is increased by the systematic use of dinucleotide models. (2) Technical limitations of the previous version, such as the inability to handle alignments with more than six sequences, are overcome by increased training data and the usage of an entropy measure to represent sequence similarities. RNAz 2.0 shows a significantly lower false discovery rate on a dinucleotide background model than the previous version. Separate models for structural alignments provide an additional way to increase the predictive power.

              amplification strategy to produce labeled RNA from a T7 RNA
              polymerase promoter, introduced during the construction of each
              mutant, followed by hybridization of this labeled RNA to a
              Typhimurium genome tiling array. To demonstrate the ability to
              identify fitness phenotypes using our pool of mutants, the pool
              was subjected to selection by intraperitoneal injection into
              BALB/c mice and subsequent recovery from spleens. Changes in the
              representation of each mutant were monitored using T7 transcripts

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Bacterial small RNAs (sRNAs) are recognized as
              posttranscriptional regulators involved in the control of
              bacterial lifestyle and adaptation to stressful conditions.
              Although chemical stress due to the toxicity of precursor and
              product compounds is frequently encountered in microbial
              bioprocessing applications, the involvement of sRNAs in this
              process is not well understood. We have used RNA sequencing to
              map sRNA expression in E. coli under chemical stress and high
              cell density fermentation conditions with the aim of identifying
              sRNAs involved in the transcriptional response and those with
              potential roles in stress tolerance. RESULTS: RNA sequencing
              libraries were prepared from RNA isolated from E. coli K-12
              MG1655 cells grown under high cell density fermentation
              conditions or subjected to chemical stress with twelve compounds
              including four organic solvent-like compounds, four organic
              acids, two amino acids, geraniol and decanoic acid. We have
              discovered 253 novel intergenic transcripts with this approach,
              adding to the roughly 200 intergenic sRNAs previously reported in
              E. coli. There are eighty-four differentially expressed sRNAs
              during fermentation, of which the majority are novel, supporting
              possible regulatory roles for these transcripts in adaptation
              during different fermentation stages. There are a total of 139
              differentially expressed sRNAs under chemical stress conditions,
              where twenty-nine exhibit significant expression changes in
              multiple tested conditions, suggesting that they may be involved
              in a more general chemical stress response. Among those with
              known functions are sRNAs involved in regulation of outer
              membrane proteins, iron availability, maintaining envelope
              homeostasis, as well as sRNAs incorporated into complex networks
              controlling motility and biofilm formation. CONCLUSIONS: This
              study has used deep sequencing to reveal a wealth of hitherto
              undescribed sRNAs in E. coli and provides an atlas of sRNA
              expression during seventeen different growth and stress
              conditions. Although the number of novel sRNAs with regulatory
              functions is unknown, several exhibit specific expression
              patterns during high cell density fermentation and are
              differentially expressed in the presence of multiple chemicals,
              suggesting they may play regulatory roles during these stress
              conditions. These novel sRNAs, together with specific known
              sRNAs, are candidates for improving stress tolerance and our

              transcriptome-wide mapping of eukaryotic RNA-binding protein

               a versatile method for characterizing RNA structure in a variety
               of contexts. SHAPE reagents covalently modify RNAs in a
               structure-dependent manner to create adducts at the 2′-OH group
               of the ribose backbone at nucleotides that are structurally
               flexible. The positions of these adducts are detected using
               reverse transcriptase (RT) primer extension, which stops one
               nucleotide before the modification, to create a pool of cDNAs
               whose lengths reflect the location of SHAPE modification.
               Quantification of the cDNA pools is used to estimate the
               ``reactivity'' of each nucleotide in an RNA molecule to the
               SHAPE reagent. High reactivities indicate nucleotides that are
               structurally flexible, while low reactivities indicate
               nucleotides that are inflexible. These SHAPE reactivities can
               then be used to infer RNA structures by restraining RNA
               structure prediction algorithms. Here, we provide a
               state-of-the-art protocol describing how to perform in vitro RNA

               higher throughput, more consistent data analysis, and
               multiplexing capabilities. The technique described herein,
               SHAPE-Seq v2.0, uses a universal reverse transcription priming
               site that is ligated to the RNA after SHAPE modification. The

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Small, untranslated RNA molecules were identified
              initially in bacteria, but examples can be found in all kingdoms
              of life. These RNAs carry out diverse functions, and many of them
              are regulators of gene expression. Genes encoding small,
              untranslated RNAs are difficult to detect experimentally or to
              predict by traditional sequence analysis approaches. Thus, in
              spite of the rising recognition that such RNAs may play key roles
              in bacterial physiology, many of the small RNAs known to date
              were discovered fortuitously. RESULTS: To search the Escherichia
              coli genome sequence for genes encoding small RNAs, we developed
              a computational strategy employing transcription signals and
              genomic features of the known small RNA-encoding genes. The
              search, for which we used rather restrictive criteria, has led to
              the prediction of 24 putative sRNA-encoding genes, of which 23
              were tested experimentally. Here we report on the discovery of 14
              genes encoding novel small RNAs in E. coli and their expression
              patterns under a variety of physiological conditions. Most of the
              newly discovered RNAs are abundant. Interestingly, the expression
              level of a significant number of these RNAs increases upon entry
              into stationary phase. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results, we
              conclude that small RNAs are much more widespread than previously
              imagined and that these versatile molecules may play important

              pathogen and is the cause of bloody diarrhea and hemolytic-uremic
              syndrome. The virulence repertoire of EHEC includes the genes
              within the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) that are largely
              organized in five operons, LEE1 to LEE5, which encode a type III
              secretion system, several effectors, chaperones, and regulatory
              proteins. In addition, EHEC also encodes several non-LEE-encoded
              effectors and fimbrial operons. The virulence genes of this
              pathogen are under a large amount of posttranscriptional
              regulation. The small RNAs (sRNAs) GlmY and GlmZ activate the
              translation of glucosamine synthase (GlmS) in E. coli K-12, and
              in EHEC they destabilize the 3' fragments of the LEE4 and LEE5
              operons and promote translation of the non-LEE-encoded effector
              EspFu. We investigated the global changes of EHEC gene expression

              their function without ever producing proteins. Noncoding RNA
              gene sequences do not have strong statistical signals, unlike
              protein coding genes. A reliable general purpose computational
              genefinder for noncoding RNA genes has been elusive. RESULTS: We
              describe a comparative sequence analysis algorithm for detecting
              novel structural RNA genes. The key idea is to test the pattern
              of substitutions observed in a pairwise alignment of two
              homologous sequences. A conserved coding region tends to show a
              pattern of synonymous substitutions, whereas a conserved
              structural RNA tends to show a pattern of compensatory mutations
              consistent with some base-paired secondary structure. We
              formalize this intuition using three probabilistic

Among the highest-scoring new predictions are 169 new miRNA candidates, as well as new candidate selenocysteine insertion sites, RNA editing hairpins, RNAs involved in transcript auto regulation, and many folds that form singletons or small functional RNA families of completely unknown function.

    abstractNote={BACKGROUND: Bacterial non-coding small RNAs (sRNAs) have attracted considerable attention due to their ubiquitous nature and contribution to numerous cellular processes including survival, adaptation and pathogenesis. Existing computational approaches for identifying bacterial sRNAs demonstrate varying levels of success and there remains considerable room for improvement. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we have proposed a transcriptional signal-based computational method to identify intergenic sRNA transcriptional units (TUs) in completely sequenced bacterial genomes. Our sRNAscanner tool uses position weight matrices derived from experimentally defined E. coli K-12 MG1655 sRNA promoter and rho-independent terminator signals to identify intergenic sRNA TUs through sliding window based genome scans. Analysis of genomes representative of twelve species suggested that sRNAscanner demonstrated equivalent sensitivity to sRNAPredict2, the best performing bioinformatics tool available presently. However, each algorithm yielded substantial numbers of known and uncharacterized hits that were unique to one or the other tool only. sRNAscanner identified 118 novel putative intergenic sRNA genes in Salmonella enterica Typhimurium LT2, none of which were flagged by sRNAPredict2. Candidate sRNA locations were compared with available deep sequencing libraries derived from Hfq-co-immunoprecipitated RNA purified from a second Typhimurium strain (Sittka et al. (2008) PLoS Genetics 4: e1000163). Sixteen potential novel sRNAs computationally predicted and detected in deep sequencing libraries were selected for experimental validation by Northern analysis using total RNA isolated from bacteria grown under eleven different growth conditions. RNA bands of expected sizes were detected in Northern blots for six of the examined candidates. Furthermore, the 5’-ends of these six Northern-supported sRNA candidates were successfully mapped using 5'-RACE analysis. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We have developed, computationally examined and experimentally validated the sRNAscanner algorithm. Data derived from this study has successfully identified six novel S. Typhimurium sRNA genes. In addition, the computational specificity analysis we have undertaken suggests that approximately 40\% of sRNAscanner hits with high cumulative sum of scores represent genuine, undiscovered sRNA genes. Collectively, these data strongly support the utility of sRNAscanner and offer a glimpse of its potential to reveal large numbers of sRNA genes that have to date defied identification. sRNAscanner is available from: http://bicmku.in:8081/sRNAscanner or http://cluster.physics.iisc.ernet.in/sRNAscanner/.},

    ISSN={1471-2105},
    abstractNote={BACKGROUND: The interest in non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) constantly rose during the past few years because of the wide spectrum of biological processes in which they are involved. This led to the discovery of numerous ncRNA genes across many species. However, for most organisms the non-coding transcriptome still remains unexplored to a great extent. Various experimental techniques for the identification of ncRNA transcripts are available, but as these methods are costly and time-consuming, there is a need for computational methods that allow the detection of functional RNAs in complete genomes in order to suggest elements for further experiments. Several programs for the genome-wide prediction of functional RNAs have been developed but most of them predict a genomic locus with no indication whether the element is transcribed or not. RESULTS: We present NOCORNAc, a program for the genome-wide prediction of ncRNA transcripts in bacteria. NOCORNAc incorporates various procedures for the detection of transcriptional features which are then integrated with functional ncRNA loci to determine the transcript coordinates. We applied RNAz and NOCORNAc to the genome of Streptomyces coelicolor and detected more than 800 putative ncRNA transcripts most of them located antisense to protein-coding regions. Using a custom design microarray we profiled the expression of about 400 of these elements and found more than 300 to be transcribed, 38 of them are predicted novel ncRNA genes in intergenic regions. The expression patterns of many ncRNAs are similarly complex as those of the protein-coding genes, in particular many antisense ncRNAs show a high expression correlation with their protein-coding partner. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed NOCORNAc, a framework that facilitates the automated characterization of functional ncRNAs. NOCORNAc increases the confidence of predicted ncRNA loci, especially if they contain transcribed ncRNAs. NOCORNAc is not restricted to intergenic regions, but it is applicable to the prediction of ncRNA transcripts in whole microbial genomes.

              establish whether annotation of existing transcriptome data has

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: NCRNAs (noncoding RNAs) play important roles in many
              biological processes. Existing genome-scale ncRNA search tools
              identify ncRNAs in local sequence alignments generated by
              conventional sequence comparison methods. However, some types of
              ncRNA lack strong sequence conservation and tend to be missed or
              mis-aligned by conventional sequence comparison. RESULTS: In this
              paper, we propose an ncRNA identification framework that is
              complementary to existing sequence comparison tools. By
              integrating a filtration step based on Hamming distance and ncRNA
              alignment programs such as FOLDALIGN or PLAST-ncRNA, the proposed
              ncRNA search framework can identify ncRNAs that lack strong
              sequence conservation. In addition, as the ratio of transition
              and transversion mutation is often used as a discriminative
              feature for functional ncRNA identification, we incorporate this
              feature into the filtration step using a coding strategy. We
              apply Hamming distance seeds to ncRNA search in the intergenic
              regions of human and mouse genomes and between the Burkholderia

              The experimental results demonstrate that a carefully designed

              comparisons. In attempts to overcome this limitation, methods
              have been developed that use as a query, not a single sequence,
              but sets of related sequences or a representation of the
              characteristics shared by related sequences. Here we describe an
              assessment of three of these methods: the SAM-T98 implementation
              of a hidden Markov model procedure; PSI-BLAST; and the
              intermediate sequence search (ISS) procedure. We determined the
              extent to which these procedures can detect evolutionary
              relationships between the members of the sequence database
              PDBD40-J. This database, derived from the structural
              classification of proteins (SCOP), contains the sequences of
              proteins of known structure whose sequence identities with each
              other are 40\% or less. The evolutionary relationships that exist
              between those that have low sequence identities were found by the
              examination of their structural details and, in many cases, their
              functional features. For nine false positive predictions out of a
              possible 432,680, i.e. at a false positive rate of about
              1/50,000, SAM-T98 found 35\% of the true homologous relationships
              in PDBD40-J, whilst PSI-BLAST found 30\% and ISS found 25\%.
              Overall, this is about twice the number of PDBD40-J relations
              that can be detected by the pairwise comparison procedures FASTA
              (17\%) and GAP-BLAST (15\%). For distantly related sequences in
              PDBD40-J, those pairs whose sequence identity is less than 30\%,
              SAM-T98 and PSI-BLAST detect three times the number of
              relationships found by the pairwise methods.",

  abstract = "Proteins might have considerable structural similarities even
              when no evolutionary relationship of their sequences can be
              detected. This property is often referred to as the proteins
              sharing only a ``fold''. Of course, there are also sequences of
              common origin in each fold, called a ``superfamily'', and in them
              groups of sequences with clear similarities, designated
              ``family''. Developing algorithms to reliably identify proteins
              related at any level is one of the most important challenges in
              the fast growing field of bioinformatics today. However, it is
              not at all certain that a method proficient at finding sequence
              similarities performs well at the other levels, or vice
              versa.Here, we have compared the performance of various search
              methods on these different levels of similarity. As expected, we
              show that it becomes much harder to detect proteins as their
              sequences diverge. For family related sequences the best method
              gets 75\% of the top hits correct. When the sequences differ but
              the proteins belong to the same superfamily this drops to 29\%,
              and in the case of proteins with only fold similarity it is as
              low as 15\%. We have made a more complete analysis of the
              performance of different algorithms than earlier studies, also
              including threading methods in the comparison. Using this method
              a more detailed picture emerges, showing multiple sequence
              information to improve detection on the two closer levels of
              relationship. We have also compared the different methods of
              including this information in prediction algorithms. For lower
              specificities, the best scheme to use is a linking method
              connecting proteins through an intermediate hit. For higher
              specificities, better performance is obtained by PSI-BLAST and
              some procedures using hidden Markov models. We also show that a
              threading method, THREADER, performs significantly better than
              any other method at fold recognition.",

              successful procedures for detecting remote homology between
              proteins. There are two popular profile HMM programs, HMMER and
              SAM. Little is known about their performance relative to each
              other and to the recently improved version of PSI-BLAST. Here we
              compare the two programs to each other and to non-HMM methods, to
              determine their relative performance and the features that are
              important for their success. The quality of the multiple sequence
              alignments used to build models was the most important factor
              affecting the overall performance of profile HMMs. The SAM T99
              procedure is needed to produce high quality alignments
              automatically, and the lack of an equivalent component in HMMER
              makes it less complete as a package. Using the default options
              and parameters as would be expected of an inexpert user, it was
              found that from identical alignments SAM consistently produces
              better models than HMMER and that the relative performance of the
              model-scoring components varies. On average, HMMER was found to
              be between one and three times faster than SAM when searching
              databases larger than 2000 sequences, SAM being faster on smaller
              ones. Both methods were shown to have effective low complexity
              and repeat sequence masking using their null models, and the
              accuracy of their E-values was comparable. It was found that the
              SAM T99 iterative database search procedure performs better than
              the most recent version of PSI-BLAST, but that scoring of
              PSI-BLAST profiles is more than 30 times faster than scoring of
              SAM models.",

              inference methods have made important contributions to the theory
              of sequence database homology search. However, practical use of
              profile HMM methods has been hindered by the computational
              expense of existing software implementations. Here I describe an
              acceleration heuristic for profile HMMs, the ``multiple segment
              Viterbi'' (MSV) algorithm. The MSV algorithm computes an optimal
              sum of multiple ungapped local alignment segments using a striped
              vector-parallel approach previously described for fast
              Smith/Waterman alignment. MSV scores follow the same statistical
              distribution as gapped optimal local alignment scores, allowing
              rapid evaluation of significance of an MSV score and thus
              facilitating its use as a heuristic filter. I also describe a
              20-fold acceleration of the standard profile HMM Forward/Backward
              algorithms using a method I call ``sparse rescaling''. These
              methods are assembled in a pipeline in which high-scoring MSV
              hits are passed on for reanalysis with the full HMM
              Forward/Backward algorithm. This accelerated pipeline is
              implemented in the freely available HMMER3 software package.
              Performance benchmarks show that the use of the heuristic MSV
              filter sacrifices negligible sensitivity compared to
              unaccelerated profile HMM searches. HMMER3 is substantially more
              sensitive and 100- to 1000-fold faster than HMMER2. HMMER3 is now
              about as fast as BLAST for protein searches.",

As of 3 October 2012, the performance of 28 single-sequence and 13 comparative methods has been evaluated on RNA sequences/structures released weekly by the Protein Data Bank. We also provide a static benchmark generated on RNA 2D structures derived from the RNAstrand database. Benchmarks on both data sets offer insight into the relative performance of RNA secondary structure prediction methods on RNAs of different size and with respect to different types of structure. According to our tests, on the average, the most accurate predictions obtained by a comparative approach are generated by CentroidAlifold, MXScarna, RNAalifold and TurboFold. On the average, the most accurate predictions obtained by single-sequence analyses are generated by CentroidFold, ContextFold and IPknot. The best comparative methods typically outperform the best single-sequence methods if an alignment of homologous RNA sequences is available. This article presents the results of our benchmarks as of 3 October 2012, whereas the rankings presented online are continuously updated.
